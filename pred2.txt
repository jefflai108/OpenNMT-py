a Re@@ public@@ an strategy to obstruc@@ t Obama &apos;s re@@ election
the Re@@ public@@ an leaders justified their policy for combating electoral fraud .
now , the Bren@@ nan Centre considers this to be a myth and says that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from the fall of a li@@ ght@@ ning .
in fact , the republic@@ ian lawyers have not found more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years .
one thing is true : these new provisions will adver@@ sely affect the participation rate .
in that sense , these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system .
contrary to what happens in Canada , American states are responsible for the organisation of the federal elections in the United States .
and in that same line a majority of American governments introduced , from 2009 , new laws which ham@@ pered the process of registration or voting .
this phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections , which saw the increase in 6@@ 75 new republic@@ ian representatives in 26 states .
consequently , in 2011 , 180 draft law was introduced which restricted the exercise of voting law in 41 states .
the new electoral laws require the voters to submit a identity document with a photo@@ graph , as well as an American citizenship test .
on the other hand , these laws reduce the pre @-@ voting periods , revo@@ ke the right to register as elec@@ tor on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to the vote to the citizens .
before the 2006 elections , no American state required the voters to submit an identity document with photo@@ graphs .
the State of Indi@@ ana was the first to demand it .
the United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitu@@ tionality of Indi@@ ana law .
therefore , the Re@@ public@@ ian authorities were rus@@ hed to extend that practice to other states .
in recent years , these authorities have supported draft law in 34 states to force the voters to present a identity document with photo@@ graphs .
it is important to bear in mind that , contrary to what is happening in Que@@ bec , American citizens do not have a universal identity document , such as the Social Security Card .
in fact , 11 % of American citizens , that is , 21 million people in the age of voting , do not have any identity documents with photo@@ graphs issued by a government agency of their state .
on the other hand , five million new voters in 2012 have no identity document with those characteristics .
but , often , the purchase of the required identity paper costs more than a hundred dollars .
so the new restrictions are disproportionate to young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
indeed , 25 % of the Americans , 15 % of people who earn less than $ 3@@ 5,000 per year , 18 % of the citizens of more than 65 and 20 % of the voters of 18 and 29 years have no identity document with photo@@ graphs .
and there is still more .
in many states students , the voters who vote for the candidates , cannot use the identity document with photo@@ graph issued by their institution .
on the other hand , these same states authori@@ ze the members of the fishing clubs or who usually vote to the republic@@ ian parties to use the documents issued by these clubs .
before 2004 no state demanded the evidence of citizenship to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first state to present that requirement .
since 2011 , a dozen states have adopted laws requiring the voters to show that they are American citizens .
these measures are clearly seeking to limit the h@@ is@@ p@@ ano vote .
it seems that two of the three h@@ is@@ p@@ ans are supporting the Democratic party .
on the other hand , the Re@@ public@@ an legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that acc@@ entu@@ ate the entry of elec@@ tors the same day in eight states .
furthermore , they limited the right of people and groups to create a service service to the voters who wish to join .
these restrictions have consequences .
for example , in the 2004 general elections , the registration campaigns of voters contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens .
the measures taken since 2009 managed to make the registration rate of new elec@@ tors fall in 2010 compared to 2006 .
furthermore , the Re@@ public@@ an legislators adopted laws in other five states which would encourage the reduction of the voting period in advance .
for example , in the 2008 elections in Florida , 33 % of the voters who voted in advance were super@@ American , while the latter did not represent more than 13 % of the voters in the state .
in the case of the h@@ is@@ p@@ ans , it would be exactly the same thing .
these do not represent more than 11 % of the voters , which amounts to 24 % of the citizens who vote in advance .
however , the white , who represent 76 % of the electorate , do not represent more than 46 % of the citizens who are voting in advance .
of course , legislators and their supporters have consistently opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters .
in this respect , the democrats have blocked several draft law .
the US prosecutor of the United States interven@@ ed to suspend the most controversial laws .
it could , in part , limit the damage .
for example , only 16 of the Member States adopted the law required to submit an identity document with photo@@ graphs .
however , it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complic@@ ate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012 .
critics condemn the parti@@ san character of the laws that have been voted on , since it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states .
a report from the Bren@@ nan Centre for 2011 shows that the states that have adopted such laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes in the electoral school to achieve the presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections .
one thing is true : these new provisions will adver@@ sely affect the participation rate .
in this respect , mining measures will partly be the American democratic system .
detection of pro@@ state cancer : is the test or not ?
indeed , the test of P@@ SA presents the wrong results , with false negative results or even false results , following those who decide to make useless medical interventions .
it is a more reason than enough to doubt men , already retic@@ ent about themselves , on whether or not testing tests should be carried out .
the test or not ?
we have asked two specialists .
in the studies carried out in the United States , a great deal of infec@@ tions was detected between the show groups , so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations .
for its part , the European study showed a certain difference of mortality between patients that had been carried out and those who do not .
the study , with a follow @-@ up to 12 years , also showed that there is between 30 and 40 % of opportunities to suffer me@@ st@@ asis if the screening test has not been carried out .
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years , or from 40 years if your father has suffered pro@@ state cancer .
the men of America have a higher risk rate .
the key is to take a good decision once detected by cancer .
there is aggressive cancer and other canc@@ ers that are ind@@ ol@@ ent .
it is really necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer , and it must be offered all possible options and not necessarily trying to treat pro@@ stat@@ s which are not against the long @-@ term life , in which case they should be chosen more by active monitoring of the disease .
today , many men who have been detected a cancer are not treated , because that cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their life .
instead , we suggest active monitoring of the disease and , if this progress is made , we offer them a deal .
we determine more and more precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated .
I recommend that the test be made in any case .
but it is important that you speak with your doctor to determine whether the test should be made or not .
in cooperation with the International Society of U@@ ro@@ logy , a tool which allows for assessing the pr@@ os and contr@@ asts of the P@@ SA test .
this document can be ruled out ( for the moment alone in English , but transl@@ ations will shortly be put in the next direction : h@@ tt@@ p :
preventing the disease
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer .
despite the progress of research , the adoption of healthy life habits remain the best way to reduce the risks of suffering the disease .
we think that if everyone started well and moved enough , it could be prevented by 30 % of canc@@ ers .
&quot; if no one smo@@ ked , that rate would , at least , rise to 50 % , &quot; underlines André Beau@@ li@@ eu , the spokes@@ man of the Canadian Society against the C@@ án@@ er .
instead , we assess that around 10 % of the canc@@ ers are her@@ edi@@ ous .
many others are still completely inexplic@@ able .
for the Canadian Society against the C@@ án@@ er , the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the reduction in the number of smo@@ kers .
tobacco is linked to 85 % of lun@@ g cancer cases .
it is also a risk factor for other types of cancer .
it damages the health of people .
today , there are still 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Que@@ bec , declared the spokes@@ man André Beau@@ li@@ eu .
a sper@@ m thing : 10 years after I stopped smoking , the risk of dying of cancer is reduced to half .
the weight
the fat and obesity also encourage the emergence of the disease , according to S@@ C@@ C .
they increase the risks of breast cancer , col@@ on and straight , of s@@ wel@@ ling , p@@ hosp@@ believe and in order .
&quot; investigations show that regular practice of physical activity throughout the life protects breast cancer , added . &quot;
food
the body recommends , equally , to limit the consumption of red meat .
in large quantities , they make the risks of suffering a col@@ rec@@ tal cancer .
chat products must also be avoided .
the preservation of meat for its a@@ hum@@ ed , dry or s@@ ail@@ or can lead to the formation of carcino@@ genic substances .
&quot; they can damage the cells of the body and bring about the development of cancer , &quot; they explain .
vitamin@@ s
in recent years , several scientists have studied links between the complex vit@@ am@@ ics and cancer .
however , for the moment your investigations are not conclu@@ sive .
according to the S@@ C@@ C , the studies on vit@@ am@@ ics are contradictory .
while in one of them there was a reduction in the risks of pro@@ state cancer , in other words it was , rather , an increase .
the effect of vit@@ am@@ ine D in cancer has not been clearly established .
on the other hand , M. Beau@@ li@@ eu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family records of each with his doctor .
&quot; the screening test does not provo@@ ke cancer . &quot;
Hig@@ gs in detail
the announcement of the Ama@@ zon of Hig@@ gs generated a great shock last summer , and rightly so .
it is believed , in fact , that this Bos@@ s are involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe , nothing more and nothing less .
and what is more , this is the role of the standard of the standard : our best or less bad explanation of nature and behaviour , which has not yet been noticed .
but for physi@@ cs it is not entirely clear that it is Hig@@ gs .
we know without any doubt that there is a new role and that it is a great deal to the Bos@@ s of the Hig@@ gs model .
in addition , new un@@ ve@@ iled data this week in a major physi@@ cian congres@@ s in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is , although there is still more data to be completely safe .
in any case , we assume that this is Hig@@ gs , because the chances of error seem to be a few .
there is , in this great world , a general and un@@ predictable law which means that two things cannot be found at the same time at the same time .
there is no way of infr@@ inging that rule and not trying to do so too much , because it will end up being damaged .
although the physi@@ cul@@ ality of parti@@ cul@@ ates is a very complex world , it has been demonstrated that there is also a law of these characteristics : the principle of exclusion of Pau@@ li , which stipulates that two par@@ ticles cannot be in the same way as they are at the same time as they are in the same state of affairs .
physical physi@@ cul@@ ates cover par@@ ticles in two categories .
on the one hand we are with the good so @-@ called fer@@ oci@@ ous citizens , which deliberately obey the principle of Pau@@ li .
and on the other hand , the Bos@@ s , an an@@ arch@@ ist s@@ anda of an@@ arch@@ ists who do not have respect for anything , or at least not for this principle , which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time .
according to the website The Par@@ ew@@ de Ad@@ venture of the Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey L@@ abor@@ tions which , by the way , is extraordinary , the Bos@@ s are divided into two groups : the wai@@ sions , which we will not talk about here , and the &apos; force par@@ ticles &apos; , for which the great forces of nature are spreading and with which the Tre@@ gs of the Hig@@ gs are in some form em@@ bed@@ ded .
these Bos@@ s , I would stress here , are not the ex@@ otic b@@ ich@@ es that we could believe .
in fact , if you can read this chron@@ ic , it is thanks to an extraordinarily ban@@ ker , the f@@ ot@@ on or the &quot; status of light &quot; which acts as &quot; mess@@ eng@@ er of the electro@@ magnetic force . &quot;
in fact , when a part with an electric burden acceler@@ ates or changes in direction , &apos; dis@@ orders &apos; the electro@@ magnetic field in that precise environment ; a little like when we launched a stone to an an@@ an@@ que .
in this &quot; n@@ ace &quot; is an electro@@ magnetic wave ( from the light , of the bre@@ eds , from the outermost vi@@ o@@ ts , etc . ) , and this wave is nothing other than a f@@ ot@@ on ; that is , one of the Bos@@ s of force .
more stable field
the same applies to the Hig@@ gs de Hig@@ gs , with the difference that it is another area , the Hig@@ gs field , which needs to be &apos; un@@ ordered &apos; for this Bos@@ s to appear .
well , the Hig@@ gs field is a lot more stable than the electro@@ magnetic field , to activ@@ ate it , is to make extremely high sources of energy , a little as if it was an ice @-@ cream st@@ an@@ que that only a giant rock could slip through the surface .
that is why we need a huge acceler@@ ator of par@@ ticles like that of the C@@ ER@@ N ( the great co@@ lli@@ sion@@ ist of H@@ ad@@ thi@@ an H@@ ad@@ ers is a ring of 27 miles away ! ) to achieve such energy levels .
an@@ alo@@ gy with electro@@ magnetic field is a new tool which explains the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and the mass .
in fact , not all the parti@@ cul@@ ates or all the inter@@ act materials are in the electro@@ magnetic field .
some , like the mag@@ ici@@ ans , do it , but others not : a piece of paper , for example , will never be kept by itself at the door of a fr@@ idge .
and in the same way , not all inter@@ act par@@ ticles do not deal with the Hig@@ gs field : those who do so have a mass , while the rest of the world , the other way , do not have it .
now , what &apos; can you do all those investigations ? &quot;
for science , this serves to verify the validity of the standard model ( Eng@@ e ) , and allow it , moreover , to ensure that the examin@@ es of the differences between the observations and pre@@ dict@@ ations of the Eng@@ ry .
for its part , many people are keen to find themselves , because the lesser difference could open a door to a &apos; new physi@@ cs &apos; which covers certain holes in the model .
this has to be said , it has to be said , it has enormous shortcomings , as it does not propose any explanation about the gravity ( - ( Chuckles ) or the dark , which con@@ forms around 80 % of the universe .
but we have not found such differences in the C@@ ER@@ N until the moment .
repercussions
the impact of these investigations on our day is difficult to predict , but we do not believe we were wrong to say that it will not have any .
in order to see : at the beginning of the 60 , the pion@@ eers of the las@@ er in labor@@ atories did not suspect the revolution that their work would cause .
they enter@@ tain scientific applications , but nothing else .
in fact , as the physical Wil@@ lard Bo@@ yle has already said , which worked on the B@@ ell labor@@ atories , where the las@@ er was invented in 19@@ 60 , and that he drew the first pro@@ tot@@ ance ( the first was the first thu@@ mb@@ s ) in 196@@ 2 , at the beginning of the p@@ age of a laboratory .
imagine ...
and furthermore , applications can also proceed with the whole operation surrounding research .
for example , the same Wil@@ lard Bo@@ yle drew up a light cap@@ t@@ ator in 196@@ 9 in the course of his research investigation .
despite the fact that it was not at all his original intention , this cap@@ t@@ ator is now of &apos; an eye &apos; for all digital appli@@ ances in the world , which was worth the physi@@ cs of physi@@ cs in 2009 .
that does not mean , of course , that the activities of the L@@ H@@ C would necessarily want to transform our lives , but never know ...
the best way to die ...
in its Commission Mor@@ ir in dignity , Que@@ bec discussed the delicate issue of the end of life .
the debate must be taken soon as a draft law is prepared .
well , in that essential domain , there is still much to do .
Dev@@ o@@ ir has tried to see him closely .
just a few weeks ago , Mr L@@ . L@@ . lived only in his apartment of the Mon@@ ther@@ é@@ gie .
the pro@@ state cancer that was destroying him had given a break of two years .
&quot; I &apos;ve been given five years of life , but I &apos;ve already been here seven &apos; , rel@@ axed , made a pass , lying in his bed at the center of Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ l in Bel@@ o@@ ei@@ l , which was the previous day .
&quot; but it is always a shock , we cannot be prepared for this .
the disease has caused him str@@ and@@ ed : a huge weakness that prevents him from going alone to the bathroom and even eating for himself .
sitting in front of an appe@@ ti@@ te lunch , he accepts that he will help him eat .
brave , it goes even to smile , to talk to the unknown people who are involved , bring him into drugs and give him a bath .
the courage of ordinary death .
&quot; my greatest wish is that I take the di@@ arr@@ am , it is humili@@ ating . &quot;
a few hours later , the team found that bad .
&quot; in the course of our lives we learn that a man is standing on foot , &quot; Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , psycho@@ log@@ ist in the centre @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is center .
return to your childhood , for certain people , is an unacceptable humili@@ ation .
&quot; that depends on the ability of the person to accept that regres@@ sion &apos; .
because , according to the opinion of the majority of people working in pal@@ li@@ ative care , the big moments are in the heart of that regres@@ sion .
all patients who enter the center of Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is are suffering cancer .
they have a three @-@ month life forecast .
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer the &apos; cure &apos; .
the greatest fear of Mrs A. , of 89 years , is to die &quot; conscious and drow@@ ned . &quot;
but the disease has made it discover its children .
&quot; I have good kids &apos; , adding .
&quot; no longer have any more wishes in this life , &quot; says , before accepting that a mass@@ age to help her breathe .
and wait , in the coming days , a last visit from your son who lives in Italy .
in Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is is offered , with a group of volunteers , the care of the body and aid to food .
they are pal@@ li@@ ative care they are given when nothing else can be done .
to help her death be more comfortable .
in Que@@ bec we have a li@@ ative care bed for every 11 700 inhabitants .
it is very little , since we know that we all end up dying someday .
here , life continues in the best possible conditions , explains Dr. Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doc@@ tors of the centre .
whether it is physical , emotional or spiritual .
the mor@@ i@@ bun@@ se is offered to be ho@@ oked up with br@@ andy or Pep@@ si , according to demand .
they are no longer controlled by their sugar rate .
death is part of the day .
yesterday evening , we served a beer to Mr X , who died in the course of the night .
this morning , your son is over the beer of the late .
&quot; we help both patients and their loved ones , &quot; fill N@@ ath@@ alie Sav@@ ard , direc@@ tor of care .
at the centre @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is center the days are never equal .
on the side of an 94 @-@ year @-@ old man who knows his last family meeting in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , well placed between his pil@@ lows while everyone drinks his health , a young woman of 36 years dies in a tragic way , surrounded by his parents , his wife and his two children , having tried to survive .
&quot; for six months , there are always three to five @-@ year @-@ old be@@ ds for minors under 45 years sick of cancer , Dr. Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel .
a 53 % of the patients who are admitted at the Victor @-@ G@@ addafi centre comes from home and 47 % of the hospital .
problem of access to pal@@ ative care
a 77 % of the Canadi@@ ans simply do not have access to pal@@ li@@ ative care , that is to say , to the care of the suffering of suffering when a sick man comes to the terminal phase of his life , in his home , in the hospital or at a centre of care .
and several bodies , such as the Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is , and the pal@@ li@@ ative care society of the Grand Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , speci@@ alise almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer .
it is precisely that great lack of health care in Que@@ bec &apos;s health care which makes many specialist doctors in fear of the adoption of a law regulating eu@@ than@@ asia and suicide .
since October , a manif@@ esto signed by emin@@ ence of pal@@ li@@ ative care , such as Dr. Bal@@ four Moun@@ t and Dr. Bernard L@@ apo@@ in@@ te , is running to show his opposition to such an initiative .
according to Dr. Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the health system of Que@@ bec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality care before the eu@@ than@@ asia is accepted .
&quot; recently , &quot; rel@@ ays , &quot; I have seen a patient passing 14 days in Ur@@ g@@ ences , with great pain without the need to alleviate it .
I fear patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate care . &quot;
and in parallel , many on@@ co@@ logi@@ sts are stubborn with their patients until the last day , despite the worst predic@@ tions .
the hopes of the survival of H@@ él@@ è@@ ne Richard Richard were already under minimal circumstances when he left the treatment of exha@@ ust therapy .
&quot; when I told my loc@@ ker that I wanted to stop the treatment , she told me that I was very sorry that I would like to stop fighting &apos; , relax .
&quot; however , she told me that there was nothing more to do ! &quot;
there is no world @-@ powerful care .
Dr. Mar@@ tel believes that 90 % of the suffer@@ ers who are asking to die to their car@@ ers who have not met them in their demands once they have been reliev@@ ed by their pain thanks to a pal@@ li@@ ative care team .
but it must be said that pal@@ li@@ ative care is not entirely powerful in terms of the treatment of pain .
according to El@@ sie Mon@@ er@@ eau , Director of the pal@@ li@@ ative care of Grand Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , patients do not respond to the treatment of the pain in an 8 % of cases .
at the end of the life , doctors often resort to pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ d@@ ation , which serves to sleep to the patient at the moment of their de@@ function , either in a s@@ por@@ an@@ ic way or permanently .
we cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of the suffering .
more and more , the disease is not reliev@@ ed to have that pal@@ li@@ ative se@@ d@@ ation .
the people who are not reliev@@ ed say all the same : &quot; I want to die . &quot;
but that doesn &apos;t necessarily mean &quot; I want eu@@ than@@ asia &apos; , but I want me to be reliev@@ ed . &quot;
the realisation of this report has been possible thanks to a schol@@ ar@@ age schol@@ ar@@ ship of the health institutes in Canada .
large @-@ scale estate scandals in Que@@ bec
civil network officials , of the B@@ TP , of political parties of political parties and of the Italian mafia mafia have , day after day , what they know of a formidable &quot; system , &apos; of which the construction industry , civil servants , politicians , trade union and mafia @-@ fighters .
a &apos; industry &apos; that went too expensive to the taxpayer &apos;s taxpayers , especially in the 1990s and 2000 .
&quot; it is curious how the system is to be sup@@ pressed once we have fallen to the big means &apos; , ir@@ on@@ it Jacques Duc@@ gus@@ ne@@ au , Member of the Commission in Que@@ bec and former Bos@@ s of the Montreal Police .
he led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011 , which was possible thanks to a thorough investigation on the brief@@ ings linked to road contracts in Que@@ bec , which the Prime Minister of that time , Jean Char@@ est , had no sense more than delaying .
the Duc@@ mat@@ ne@@ au report established a direct link between the industry , the illegal financing of parties and corruption between officials .
&quot; since the start of research in 2010 , only the transport minis@@ trat@@ or would have saved millions of dollars in contracts &apos; , bearing some of its inst@@ inc@@ ts to stay with a proportional part .
the Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission has already dropped two may@@ ors , adding , while waiting to be able to come to &quot; show the existing links behind individuals &apos; .
a permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011
the permanent anti @-@ corruption unit , created in 2011 , applies also to its inter@@ venture team , researchers and analy@@ sts of the government .
this unit also works with the police police police officers , which , since 2009 , have made the &apos; se@@ wer cartel of Montreal being modest in inf@@ alling contracts .
these last few weeks , the unit has taken the record on a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges as Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ co@@ t@@ te , mayor of a city of the outside .
the next list would be Gil@@ les V@@ ai@@ ll@@ anc@@ our@@ t , who has just resig@@ ned from his mayor of Lav@@ al , third city of Que@@ bec .
it is suspected that bri@@ bes have been made in exchange for public contracts .
it has been formally accused of the Montreal network of Montreal and of Italian entrepreneurs , as Tony Ac@@ progress and L@@ ino Z@@ ambi@@ to .
the latter has caused con@@ motion to explain to the committee the mechan@@ ical system of public procurement .
he himself paid for three years of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a li@@ ghtly linked bro@@ ker to the mafia that transferred money to Union Mon@@ tr@@ é@@ al , the mayor G@@ ér@@ ald Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay party .
Mr Z@@ ambi@@ to shared money to di@@ ve and sini@@ ster during the years 2000 , giving more than 8@@ 8@@ ,000 Canadi@@ ans ( approximately EUR 6@@ 8@@ ,000 ) to provin@@ cial parties , especially the liber@@ als in power .
he admitted , equally , to have organised a collection of illegal funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister , N@@ ath@@ alie Nor@@ man@@ de@@ au .
the inflation of the cost of the se@@ aled contracts
in Montreal , the &apos; corruption system worked effectively .
Gil@@ les Sur@@ pren@@ ant , ex@@ engine@@ er of public works , made it perfectly clear to the committee : in ten years he received gifts , invit@@ ations , golf tor@@ s , restaur@@ ants , ho@@ c@@ key parties and companies from the construction of the construction sector for a total of 7@@ 3@@ 6@@ ,000 dollars .
other network officials have admitted that they received money for inf@@ alling bills between 30 % and 40 % in the concept of false ex@@ tras .
in addition , an organis@@ er of the mayor &apos;s party , Martin Du@@ mont , accused M. Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay of having taken a blind eye on a parallel budget and filled his money on dirty money .
following these revel@@ ations , M. Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay resig@@ ned at the beginning of November and took Montreal to a huge crisis .
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ le@@ au was one of the first elected policies of Montreal that made the alarm sound .
as mayor of Ri@@ vi@@ ère @-@ des @-@ P@@ ra@@ i@@ ries , in the east of the island , it was opposed since 2010 to the sale of a municipal land acquired by $ 5 million and by 1.@@ 6 million to the buildings in full buildings .
70 % of the money campaign was dirty money
the research that will finally be carried out , she ensures that he puts &apos; a thre@@ ad in order to understand the operation of the system , in@@ fil@@ trate , to stop the winners and to fish the cul@@ pri@@ ts . &quot;
and add that the process is &quot; painful , but positive . &quot;
we are cleaning up the wounds but there would be a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very alert to the dubious practices not repeated .
how to clean up .
regularly .
Jacques Duc@@ gus@@ ne@@ au , for his part , declar@@ es that &apos; officials have stolen hundreds of millions of millions of dollars , &quot; but it is worrying about the role of the &apos; elected politicians &apos; as well .
I estimate at 70 % the proportion of dirty money allocated to the financing of electoral campaigns in Que@@ bec , ir@@ on@@ ine : &quot; I have told you that this is just a reflection of reality . &quot;
the government is proposing to limit 100 bucks to the parties , but that will not change the donation , according to it , &apos; while not strictly limiting electoral expenses , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
it advocates a complete revision of the system of public procurement and financing parties : &apos; we cannot fall lower ; go to the bottom of things , with courage , it will enable us to rebuild the house with stronger , more controls and more laws . &quot;
if this story pa@@ ins the international image of Que@@ bec and Montreal , M. Duc@@ gus@@ ne@@ au invit@@ es those who would look at the mirror .
&quot; the P@@ S@@ G is not the Barcelona F@@ C ! &quot;
this season has acquired a new entity with the P@@ S@@ G .
how would you explain that advance ?
it could be explained by an individual conscience , but also for the new part of the P@@ S@@ G .
big players have arrived .
I &apos;m moving on day to your side .
the technical staff also brought me a lot .
and these elements push me every day to raise the level of my game .
in a party , that is easier .
everything goes very fast in football .
but I don &apos;t get excited .
from my begin@@ nings at the E@@ F Cl@@ ai@@ re@@ fon@@ taine Centre to my step by Saint @-@ E@@ tien@@ ne , I have always made a step forward .
it is going to gain the benefit of the competition recru@@ ited by C@@ arlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti .
the recru@@ ited of this summer are used to having high @-@ level parties .
they know that every training is crucial .
that makes a player like me wanting to fight and give it everything .
on the other hand , C@@ arlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti brings me very much on my position .
he &apos;s backed up as Claude M@@ ak@@ el@@ ele , who played the same position as I am .
An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti is the man who needed the team ?
of course .
An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti inspi@@ res respect for all the tech@@ nici@@ ans .
today , there is no one in the League 1 and is among the best European train@@ ers .
it has a great deal of experience and has gained many tit@@ les with the best clubs .
he worked with great players .
I think it will take other tit@@ les in Paris .
in January I had a very reas@@ suring conversation with him .
I just came out of a number of injuries .
trust in me also explains my good performance .
what do you think about the P@@ S@@ G in the first part of the season ?
in the League 1 , Lyon has removed us from leader .
but we are still in the am@@ bush .
one of our biggest objectives is the champi@@ ons League : we have classified for the eigh@@ ties in the end .
what is the aim of the club in this competition ?
we &apos;re going to try to get this as far as possible .
from now on , anything can happen .
but we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams .
we want , in order to begin , to end the first of our li@@ ga face in order to be able to receive the back of the eigh@@ th .
can the P@@ S@@ G become a great European club in the short term ?
it already has the budget ...
to become a great European club , Paris has to win tit@@ les and be there in the long term .
today , that is not the case .
at the economic level , the P@@ S@@ G is delivered to its means so that this project will be implemented .
don &apos;t win the glass in the League 1 , as in the last season , would it be a great failure ?
of course , it would be a great disappointment .
this year we are going to invest all our efforts to take that title of champi@@ ons .
in the last season we didn &apos;t go far .
in May we are disappointed , as we were counting on the op@@ tim@@ al conditions to finish first .
we had a strong season .
we ended up with 79 points .
normally , with 79 points we should have been champi@@ ons ...
but another team , the Mont@@ pe@@ lli@@ er , had a rather better season .
this year I think it will be good .
even if the big teams such as the Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le , the Lyon and the Bur@@ deos are fighting for the title , I think we have the weapons to take it .
do you think the means expect more than the P@@ S@@ G ?
it is normal to wait for a lot of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have .
we have accepted it completely .
after we win 4 @-@ 0 at Tro@@ ings , who are still with things that repro@@ ach us is a little frustrated .
we wonder what people expect .
we can never win 4 @-@ 0 every weekend .
we &apos;re not the F@@ C Barcelona !
we tried to launch a game of game .
a team is built in time .
in the champi@@ ons League we have shown that we can respond and be present .
look at Manchester City , which , after two seas@@ ons , has not managed to classi@@ fy for an eigh@@ th end , and they have also invested a great deal !
in view of the sums invested , we would imagine with 15 points of advantage to the day .
that would be neglected to our opponents and the French champi@@ on@@ ship .
Lyon and Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le , which were not well the previous season , have been &apos; driven &apos; by this new P@@ S@@ G .
that shows that the League 1 is passionate .
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that , despite all the difficulties , we have ended up taking the tro@@ phy .
the P@@ S@@ G seems totally dependent on Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ ov@@ ic successes .
better let us say we have a &quot; Z@@ lat@@ an@@ dependence . &quot;
that means that I@@ bra@@ an@@ ov@@ ic is very competent and that a lot of go@@ ats will come .
it has come to show that it is the star of the League 1 .
and it has shown in all teams that it has been a great player , a world star .
in the group we respect the man and the player .
and he also respects men around him .
what he has done is truly exceptional .
that leads to others to increase their level of play .
Thi@@ ago Silva , one of the best advocates of the world , allows us all to make progress .
how have you lived the Euro 2012 with the French team ?
it was a disappointment .
I was very excited to take part in this Euro@@ glass .
unfortunately , my l@@ ession prevented me from catching up the game of game .
I saw things there and I was reinforced .
today I can play good parties in the selection .
it &apos;s what I expected from my b@@ ap@@ tism with the &apos; ble@@ us &apos; .
we learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behaviour today .
what vision do you have from Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ sham@@ ps in the front of the &apos; ble@@ us &apos; ?
it &apos;s getting results .
they are all right in the classification group for the World Cup .
the selec@@ tor is rigorous , close to players and inspi@@ res to win .
as the case of Laur@@ ent Bl@@ anc was .
but I don &apos;t want to make compar@@ is@@ ons .
Bl@@ anc achieved his objective of classi@@ fying us for the Euro@@ glass .
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ sham@@ ps will take the selection to Brazil .
the pack ( 1 @-@ 1 ) of 16 October in Spain served to lay the foundations ?
that game gave us confidence .
everyone fought for everyone .
before that shock in Spain , there was no similar game in my entire career .
with B@@ it@@ coin , pay and sell without banks
contrary to current monetary exchanges , based on central banks , the transactions identified and the processing burden between the parties .
moreover , as often happens in technologies , the political vision is pal@@ p@@ able : the conviction that the current monetary system , composed of bank monopolies , leads to financial crises .
in fact , B@@ it@@ coin , invented by S@@ ato@@ shi N@@ ak@@ am@@ oto ( a pse@@ ud@@ y@@ m ) , is at the same time a virtual currency conver@@ tible to dollars , euros , and a safe change protocol to the way in which they are in the same way .
they have been close to 200 000 transactions thanks to 15@@ ,000 computers from the network .
and close to a thousand websites , they accept the bit@@ ches like donations or as a payment .
the co@@ los@@ sal of the bit@@ oon , having arrived at the top of $ 30 ( 23 ) in June 2011 , fell to $ 2 months later , before I come back to the ten dollars ( the contributions were given on the web page .
it is nothing impressive if we compare the world &apos;s changes in real currency or financial products .
however , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) was interested in it in a report on the virtual coins published in October .
it was described in it as &quot; the virtual currency with more success &apos; , &quot; which compete with the dollar or the euro &apos; and &quot; similar to conventional currencies . &quot;
B@@ it@@ coin is different from other systems with virtual coins such as &apos; credits &apos; , used to make progress in a par@@ o@@ o@@ ot and that they can be bought , or even at times , to be bought .
the F@@ ace@@ book social network also developed this type of system .
but in all exchanges a central authority controls and deals with changes .
with the bit@@ oon , all the network &apos;s no@@ ises are at the same time deposi@@ ts of accounting books , veri@@ fi@@ ers , currency broadcast@@ ers and bu@@ yers and sel@@ lers .
how does that network work ?
each compromise between two users is actually between two electronic addresses in the form of e @-@ mail .
a user can choose a different direction for every payment , thereby guaranteeing the an@@ on@@ im@@ ate .
a set of detailed information to this compromise is signed electron@@ ically by a dual @-@ key system of calcul@@ ating .
the network can thus verify the auth@@ enti@@ city of the transaction .
thanks to the content of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the record changes are recorded in the public accounts book , which is spread throughout the network .
the key milestone is to write that new transaction into that book .
this is by the resolution of a mathem@@ ati@@ cal challenge launched to computers and the winner , a sort of temporary model ban@@ ker , will have the privilege of adding that supplementary line .
this is a stage of tro@@ w@@ ning , that is , of transform@@ ing a large file in a shorter and unique numer@@ ical foot@@ print .
computers &apos; co@@ des &apos; the new transaction and add a number before &quot; tro@@ op &apos; .
the aim is to find the number offered by a particular print ( more cher@@ ns at the beginning ) .
once that number is found , the other no@@ ts easily verify that it is good .
the compromise is then in@@ destruc@@ tably linked to the joint chain of the other transactions ; changes would change the foot@@ print .
if , to commit fraud , a user would like to pay twice with the same very fast money ( in less than ten minutes ) , the network would only accept one of the two transactions ; the other would be or@@ p@@ han , as they have different fingerprints .
the computer to solve the challenge is 50 bit@@ ches .
to avoid inflation , that reward is divided in two regularly , with prob@@ ability before the end of 2012 .
the number of bit@@ ches in circulation is , therefore , limited to 21 million , but they are visible to the seventh , which leaves a broad margin .
the difficulty of this challenge is also shown in every increase in the calculation power .
the life of the network already has its al@@ ti@@ low .
the websites which provide services for B@@ it@@ coin have been attacked and rob@@ bed in storage .
&quot; the failure used does not affect the same protocol &apos; , it ensures Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , which has just launched Pay@@ mi@@ um , a real payment company that uses the B@@ it@@ coin network .
the ECB also takes into account the opportunities for money laundering thanks to this anonymous service .
but cash in cash presents the same defec@@ t .
weight actors like Wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a reject the payments of this type .
others , like the W@@ ord@@ press platform , accept them .
recently , A@@ di S@@ ham@@ ir and Dor@@ it Ron , of the We@@ ir@@ mann We@@ ek in Israel , looked at the accounting book and showed that near 80 % of the bit@@ oon does not flow .
in November , the &apos; gi@@ ants &apos; re@@ ats were launched .
&quot; they changed $ 30@@ ,000 , &quot; J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ abu@@ l , who makes the gold in gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , the author of a phon@@ ag@@ logical book on that currency , believes enough in the potential of this technology , as well as in the network of transactions .
his system , Pay@@ tun@@ ia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in actual currency ) or a mobile payment without contact , but it uses B@@ it@@ coin to valid@@ ate transactions , which are more cheap .
the carrier also manag@@ es their identity and can therefore remain in the an@@ on@@ im@@ ate .
the system is easy to put in place in the eating , which do not have to set up new termin@@ als or suf@@ foc@@ ates .
it is enough to provide an address that a phone can &apos; photo@@ graph@@ ate and recognise &apos; , &quot; it requires Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , which ensures thousands of users .
there is a general movement of a review of the hier@@ arch@@ ic systems for more horizontal systems .
&quot; it will need a time for B@@ it@@ coin to be imposed , but in 2013 there could be a change &apos; , predicted .
on the other hand , in his report the ECB envisages re@@ valu@@ ing the various risks , today considered high , in the event that this currency is successful .
we got out of Afghanistan .
and then ?
the French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan ( K@@ ap@@ isa and S@@ uro@@ bi ) .
NATO and the Americans must get out of 2014 .
it is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and that the Afgh@@ ans choose their future , without waiting for any of us .
we have punished above all the Afghan farmers , whom we considered terrorists .
and we ourselves , with our 88 soldiers murdered , more wounded and muti@@ l@@ ated .
the Taliban count on foreign extremists and former bos@@ ses in Pakistan , but often with farmers who reject the presence of the foreign army , such as in the Soviet times .
they want to defend their traditions , old and ar@@ cha@@ ic , even if the Budd@@ h@@ ers are together , the Pakist@@ ani , the Arab@@ s , the U@@ z@@ bec@@ os or the ta@@ y@@ ik@@ os .
toler@@ ated , sometimes even helped by local in@@ surg@@ ents , these will no longer be when the Western people are more discre@@ et .
the game of French troops on the basis of the Ni@@ j@@ r@@ ab , which I observed from the hi@@ lls of the hi@@ lls , thanks to the French funds , was made in order .
the con@@ vo@@ ys of lorries and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack , monitored by helicop@@ ters .
there will be no influx of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014 .
the circumstances have changed from its ir@@ resis@@ tible progress between 1994 and 1996 .
Kabul was then empty and the country is in fire and blood because of the strugg@@ les between different fac@@ tions .
his control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liber@@ ation , the return to security .
the Afgh@@ ans have paid the price of the obs@@ cure of their past farmers over the organisation Al @-@ Qaeda , but their situation is not better today .
the old mu@@ gs , the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to maintain women in a lower position .
the main person@@ alities of the anti @-@ Soviet war came back to power in 2001 .
they have become specul@@ ators , making it with government areas to reloc@@ ate them as solar refugees for the refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting from large US contracts .
they are dis@@ credi@@ ted ; most of them have not fought .
people , as I heard in the field , aspire to a government that is not composed of thi@@ eves .
many young people want to leave , as they will also be able to exploit American generosity : the capital le@@ ak is considerable .
young people are tired of war and their ide@@ o@@ logies .
they have lived the modern world during their ex@@ ile in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages .
with approximately 65 % of its younger population , Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants , a fifth of the total population .
in cities , state schools are full of girls and children .
we will have to work to those young people who will not want to return to the obs@@ cure of the old parties or to corruption of certain leaders .
everyone , including the armed opposition , is in the light of mobile phones .
the army is now present .
are the authorities that want to lead the country ?
the old anti@@ qu@@ ants of the anti @-@ Soviet struggle are already concerned about re@@ establishing prov@@ inc@@ al mili@@ tias , which will run from central power .
Afghanistan , the country of mountains , of strong local identities , should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation of the Western nations , but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralised state , with strong presidential power , by removing the post of the first minister that existed since the 196@@ 4 Constitution .
President Kar@@ z@@ ai does not want foreign control , particularly for the elections planned in April 2014 .
however , its country depends on foreign aid since 50 and even before .
no industry has re@@ established its services , no emb@@ o@@ se has been set up , and the important ir@@ rig@@ ation systems have been repa@@ ired .
everything is imported and there is nothing except fruit and vegetables .
the priority is left to the private initiative .
in a country ruined after 30 years of war , government control would have been necessary .
the rumor that Afghanistan poss@@ essed huge mining rich@@ es .
and that did nothing but increase the feeling that the Western people were there to take care of them .
without energy to extr@@ act iron miner@@ als or of the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains , there is no mining exploitation .
the Chinese have already abandoned M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak &apos;s rocket mines , letting the international ar@@ cha@@ logi@@ sts ( financed by the World Bank ) Ex@@ c@@ ept the vast location and remain there as the most important employers in the province .
it will also require Afghanistan and Pakistan , which is widely dependent on imports and exports , to establish their normal relations .
the French troops signed on 20 November .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls &apos; schools , schools of children , a French department in college , the French Institute , the cooperation in the military , legal and agricultural fields and support for the ar@@ cha@@ ological delegation .
since 2009 , with the aim of trying to &apos; win the hearts and spirits &apos; and to carry out the impossible task of making the aid and offensive actions agreed , a service of &apos; civil actions and in tens of agricultural and agricultural rehabilitation &apos; in tens of mountains in tens of mountains .
these work , I enjoy local labour , has been able to help contain the in@@ surg@@ ency : ri@@ ego , po@@ ols , drinking water , refor@@ ture , fruit trees , solar and growing areas of cultivation .
what will we leave as I recall two million euro military expenditure ?
a more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions , very harsh in those val@@ les often more than 2,000 feet .
the Emb@@ assy received tens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in K@@ ap@@ isa province .
for the release of the in@@ surg@@ ency carried out by the foreign groups , something that farmers have told me that they want to maintain a small civil , well @-@ controlled , well @-@ controlled aid .
a cr@@ ab constitution in Egypt
it is a new double or nothing from President Moham@@ med Mor@@ si .
while Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional statement , which gives him full full powers , he decided to play everything for everything .
he took the whole world for surprise on Wednesday , when he announced that the Constitutional Assembly would vote for his final text to the next day .
just a week ago , the Head of State had given two more months to this House to end its work .
and almost two years ago , Egypt uses a provisional text , several times amended , which weak@@ ens institutional stability and leads to judicial shocks .
this new initiative has only to increase the divide in the country .
for its opponents , the President persever@@ es in his &quot; autocr@@ atic &quot; and continues to &quot; betr@@ ay his word &quot; and &apos; tram@@ pled the right &apos; .
on the part of his supporters , it is ensured that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process .
in the next 15 days , a referendum should be organised .
a very short time lap@@ se oblig@@ es Her@@ ther@@ s to give up their draft explaining the text , article by article , to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
for the president , it is also a way of recover@@ ing a democratic and democratic legiti@@ mis@@ ation while the controversial cause of the whole country .
Moham@@ med Mor@@ si seems to be convinced that the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will vote in favour of it , as stated in an interview on the American agenda Time .
in view of the fact that this resource has been voted very quickly , it contains an ulti@@ mat@@ um for the Egyptian people : &apos; or vote my text or I maintain the full powers &apos; , powers which are supposedly to end with the adoption of the Constitution .
this strange atmosphere in which 85 members of this constituent House , Islam@@ ist in their large majority , voted on the text yesterday .
the majority of Liberals didn &apos;t come to the call .
in mid @-@ November , a little before the constitutional statement had closed the door because they felt they were unable to assert their views .
the representatives of human rights , religious minorities and civil society did the same .
in order to achieve the qu@@ or@@ um necessary , yesterday morning , 11 people were added , substitu@@ tes , all hurry .
some of them are very close to Muslim Bro@@ thers .
as I was expected , the articles voted on have been unanimous .
the comm@@ ent@@ ators makes them funny , on the other hand , the fact that one of the few differences in the day has been expressed almost in the time of the pr@@ ayer , so several members of the committee came to think that the timing of the constitution was wrong .
the text , which I was late yesterday , is still being voted on , of 2@@ 34 articles .
Article 2 , the subject of all the eyes , remains identical to the Constitution of the 197@@ 1 Constitution , which would estimate &apos; the principles of the Sh@@ aria constitute the main source of the right &apos; .
the party parties , for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim , expected that the principles &apos; &apos; rules &apos; should be replaced by &apos; the rules &apos; , which would have allowed more stringent implementation .
for Islam@@ ists , that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of its good will and its respect for the other components of Egyptian society .
the liber@@ als have to be hypocritical , and they think that it is not more than an adverti@@ sement .
according to them , the Islam@@ isation of the Constitution is made through other articles .
they refer , in particular , to Article 220 , which gives the University @-@ Az@@ h@@ ar University a consul@@ tative role , particularly for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with the laws of the Sh@@ aria .
according to the speci@@ alist in Egypt Sophie Pom@@ mi@@ er , it is worrying because &apos; people call to speak is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy .
we see the premises of a the@@ ocr@@ acy .
the fears of Liberals are also increasing by the fact that the next govern@@ or of that university would be rather less moderate than the present .
&quot; for now , there is no specific religious involvement .
with this Constitution we are in the context of the civil state .
the majority of the jur@@ ists who have worked in this text are not un@@ sub but university , some of them formed in the French system , explains Alex@@ is Bl@@ ou@@ et , which prepar@@ es a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition .
but it recognises that there may be some ambiguity about Article 220 , because the terms used by the religious voc@@ abul@@ ary .
&quot; we refer specifically to the term i@@ q@@ h ( Islamic law , n@@ d@@ l@@ r ) .
and the question that could be raised in the future would be what the competent civil judges are to decide above all this .
beyond its religious character , the text voted on yesterday has received a great deal of criticism concerning the widespread powers that the President of the Republic attaches .
Muslim Bro@@ thers will claim that they are few compared to those in the previous regime .
another contentious point : the powers conferred on the army .
according to the wish of the military , the budget review will not be subject to Parliament , but a national defence council .
there will also be no ban on civilian prosecu@@ tions in military courts , as requested by the defence associations for human rights .
they also showed their concerns about the text , which they consider to be released .
the crime of blas@@ ph@@ emy is maintained and , from now on , insul@@ ts are banned , which could lead to serious consequences for freedom of expression , especially the press .
moreover , no article emphasises the protection of women , underlines H@@ eb@@ a Mor@@ ay@@ ef of Human Rights Watch .
according to her , the only positive thing was the ban on torture in accordance with Article 36 .
the word was not in the previous Constitution .
although the Egyptian president had to leave yesterday night at television , demonstrations are planned for this afternoon .
the supporters of the Head of State were expressed on Saturday .
in Israel , Ukrainian tourists expect the holy land , the world &apos;s om@@ el and a sea of sal@@ dies .
the Earth promised combin@@ es the maj@@ ines of bi@@ blic@@ al tru@@ ths with modern comfort and a Pri@@ stina .
&quot; A@@ CS &quot; identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited .
Rever@@ end in Santa
it &apos;s worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed .
it is believed that anyone who enters into this &quot; b@@ ap@@ ch@@ sm@@ al &quot; will receive the div@@ ine grace .
and Gali@@ lee , the place of the mirac@@ les of Jesus : the conversion of water in the wedding , walking on the waters , the ap@@ aci@@ tion of the storm and the re@@ ple@@ tes .
in this same place , Jesus appeared to his dis@@ plays after the resur@@ rec@@ tion .
but the greatest number of s@@ ain@@ ts are in Jerusalem .
the beli@@ ever@@ s cut here the Vi@@ ac@@ ru@@ ci@@ s or the Cam@@ ino of the Red Cross ( in Latin C@@ aba Dol@@ or@@ osa ) .
it starts in the For@@ tress of Antonio , the Pre@@ tro , where the trial was carried out , and continues to be the streets of the Vi@@ eld City , it goes to the Holy Se@@ pul@@ sk@@ o in the Mon@@ t G@@ ó@@ l@@ drop , the place of the cruci@@ fi@@ logy , the Pi@@ ed@@ ra and the place of Jesus .
in this same place , the symbolic Christian @-@ bloo@@ ding of the world , which symbo@@ li@@ ses mankind &apos;s salv@@ ation .
and the mon@@ aster@@ y of the Santa Cruz in Jerusalem , built in the place where , according to a Christian leg@@ end , there was a tree that was made to the cross@@ roads of Jesus .
in Jerusalem , there is also the most sacred place for Jews , the journalist of the Lam@@ ent@@ ations ; the remains of a destroyed temp@@ le by the Rom@@ ans in the year 70 .
as tradition , people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes , which will then become reality .
make a vertical trip
the ru@@ ins of For@@ tress Mas@@ ada was what was left of a secret shelter against enemies , which Her@@ o@@ des the Gran@@ de sent to build in the year 25 .
they are in the mountains of mountains to a height of 450 m on the level of the sea .
and to arrive there for their own means , they can only be used to the escalation .
the others can get to this historic summit at the funeral .
and in the north of the country to an al@@ titu@@ de of 16@@ 00 @-@ 20@@ 40 , it is the famous Her@@ mon ski station , where in the winter months there is a huge influx of tourists .
so far , from the foot of the hill , bus services are offered .
the full length of ski @-@ ski routes is 45 km
according to an old leg@@ end , at the top of the mountain of the mountains , they were supposed to pay for a few people .
visiting single muse@@ ums
there are around 300 muse@@ ums in this country .
in a single trip you can &apos;t visit them all .
but it is worth visiting at least five of them , the most interesting .
among them is the Israeli Mu@@ se@@ o , near the K@@ nes@@ set ( Parliament ) .
in it , the former Man@@ us@@ cri@@ ts of the Mu@@ erto or Rol@@ los Sea are retained , discovered in the c@@ aves of the desert of Ju@@ dea , and around 500 billion ar@@ cha@@ ological and anti@@ po@@ po@@ logical pieces .
it &apos;s worth visiting Ar@@ te Avi@@ v in T@@ el Avi@@ v .
in his pa@@ int@@ ings of pa@@ int@@ ings of impres@@ sion@@ ist and om@@ ion@@ ists such as Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ arr@@ o , Ren@@ o@@ ir , C@@ é@@ z@@ anne , S@@ is@@ ley , M@@ atis@@ se , Mo@@ dig@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all , Mo@@ di@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all or Pic@@ as@@ so .
in Ac@@ re , the Bas@@ ha @-@ bathroom muse@@ um can be visited , which are some of the old @-@ year @-@ old Turks with a model of visitors and ba@@ thers of that time .
in C@@ es@@ eway , it is worth going through the exclusive private muse@@ um Ral@@ li , where Ro@@ din and Dal@@ í &apos;s cultures can be looked at .
there &apos;s no tourist gu@@ ts there or su@@ ven@@ es .
the entry is free , and categorically not accepted .
the fifth , the Holo@@ ca@@ ust of the Holo@@ ca@@ ust or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in T@@ el Avi@@ v , shows one of the most dramatic pages of history .
the most tragic section is the Mem@@ orial of children , built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and the gas cameras .
in it and you find yourself in absolute darkness .
the stars shine .
and they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of countries in which they lost their lives .
Ukraine is also mentioned .
health
the three main tourist areas in Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea , the Red Sea and the Mu@@ erto Sea .
in every one of them there are ho@@ ols , par@@ ic par@@ ks , dol@@ ph@@ ars and oc@@ e@@ ano@@ graphic muse@@ ums .
it is curious that in the Red Sea , even in the months of winter , the temperature of the water does not fall from 21 degrees and the air is hot to 23 degrees .
the Mu@@ erto Sea is even more warm and there is a bath over the whole year .
by the way , this sea , the most extraordinary in the world , is at the bottom of the planet : to 4@@ 17 m below the sea level .
blue waters from there are a sal@@ die that easily sustain those who do not know how to swim .
the landscap@@ es are really beautiful .
people come here to take treatment courses with salt water , save and cur@@ ti@@ fy their health in cases of der@@ nu@@ tis , aller@@ gies , as@@ th@@ y@@ tis , aller@@ gies , ar@@ tri@@ tis , aller@@ gies , ar@@ tri@@ tis , ec@@ on@@ y@@ tis , diabetes and to put their bre@@ asts in order .
playing the myster@@ ies of anti@@ ority
keep the old part of T@@ el Avi@@ v , the J@@ aff@@ a , in the Mediterranean coast .
for her , the famous maritime route I would join Egypt , Syria , An@@ ato@@ lia and M@@ es@@ o@@ pot@@ ami@@ a .
the city is mentioned in the former Greek and Egyptian leg@@ ends .
according to the leg@@ end , it was here where No@@ é built its ar@@ ch and Per@@ se@@ o rescu@@ ed the beautiful An@@ dr@@ ó@@ me@@ da with whom , in this place , took a long and happy life .
tourists love to spend on the close streets that have the names of the signs of the Z@@ odi@@ ac signs .
they say that if you touch the walls on your own &apos; symbol , the fortune will be favourable .
in J@@ aff@@ a , we can find new@@ married couples who come from all parts of Israel , and even from other countries to photo@@ graph .
and in C@@ es@@ area , the city of King Her@@ o@@ des , the Roman theatre , can pass on to the Roman the@@ ater , &apos; to take the strength of the cross .
in the Roman era , C@@ es@@ area was the main city of Ju@@ dea and the residence of the Rom@@ ans , including Pon@@ cio Pil@@ ate .
the the@@ ater , carefully restored , is used now for certain night and par@@ ticles of opera .
tourists remember
if you travel to Israel , don &apos;t worry if your English leaves a lot to be desired : in this country around 30 % of the Russian people speak Russian .
the money for this trip is not advisable to take it into euros , but in dollars , which can easily be changed to sh@@ el@@ ch@@ els ( currently 1 @-@ 3 , 8 sh@@ els ) .
urban transport consists mainly of buses , but in Jerusalem there are fast tr@@ aces and in Hai@@ fa the only line of the country , which consists of six stations and connec@@ ts the Baj@@ a City with the High City .
actually , it &apos;s a sub@@ way .
trav@@ eling in any kind of public transport costs 6 sh@@ é@@ qu@@ els and this price can be trav@@ eled over for 1.5 hours .
in Israel , according to the Jewish tradition , the she@@ ets are celebrated .
from the night of Friday until the sun@@ set of Saturday , markets and st@@ ores are closing and public transport stops its work .
but Sunday morning is starting a new job week .
in many caf@@ es , restaur@@ ants and hot@@ els only use ko@@ sher , which exclu@@ des pig meat , mar@@ is@@ co , fish without s@@ cam@@ s and pl@@ ates in which milk and meat are combined .
there is a wide range of pl@@ ates on the basis of beef and lam@@ b .
in the streets of Israeli cities , there are no street dogs .
on the other hand , there are many good cats who are fed up to their taste in an im@@ rapporteur .

Israel in figures
in 2012 , they visited Israel more than three million tourists across the world .
most of those who came to the country and rest from US citizens , Russia , France , Germany , Italy , Britain and Ukraine .
the Pro@@ me@@ ated Earth , in January 2012 , was visited by 1@@ 18@@ .@@ 8 000 Ukrainian tourists , the amount exceed@@ ing by 51 % of the year 2010 , before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011 .
&quot; the big and powerful &quot; will take you to Moscow : immigrants save for language .
while MEPs and defenders of human rights argue about the consequences of the law on compulsory examination , they have already appeared in the country that trade with fake certificates . &quot;
every year , 13 million migrant workers arrive at Moscow , St Peters@@ burg and other cities in Russia .
in its majority are citizens of Central Asian countries : Uzbekistan , Taj@@ ik@@ istan and Turkmenistan .
its only objective is to win money to help their families who have become home .
since 1 December , a law is in force , according to which every worker in labour will have to carry out an examination of the language of the Russian language .
for now , this rule is applicable only for those who intend to work in the services sector , Community institutions , domestic services and trade services .
however , with the time , as they promised in the Federal Im@@ migration Service , the checks will be made mandatory for all immigrants .
in addition , it will not be enough to monitor the language , if not also Russian history and the basis of the legislation .
the knowledge of language will be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit .
the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the official language .
they will not be subject to this law , people who managed to obtain their education certificates and diplomas before the Soviet Union dis@@ solution in 1991 .
useful , fat@@ ality and defence of the rights
the network of centres examined by the European Institute of Langu@@ age P@@ ush@@ kin , the University of the Coun@@ ty of the Tami@@ los , the Turkish University of Moscow , the State University of St Peters@@ burg and other more Russian education institutions .
immigrants will be able to submit to the tests in all cities , right now in Russia are more than 160 of this type .
the initiative on the introduction of the examination was supported by the members of the State Duma and by the Federal Im@@ migration Service .
but the defenders of rights , a lot before the law entered into force , did many times make this question to the press : and what will this actually bring ?
what changes will it bring to the compulsory knowledge of language , both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves ?
first of all , they respond to the representatives of the In@@ migration Service , this will allow the number of people suffering from &apos; labour slavery &apos; .
a lot of people speak today about the defence of the rights of labour rights , it explains Victor S@@ eb@@ len@@ tor , Chief of the representation of the Russian Elec@@ migration Service in Taj@@ ik@@ istan .
the defence of its rights must begin before its departure .
only a system of organised selection will enable the problem of migrant workers to be resolved by 90 % of cases .
the problems have immigrants without profession , education , those who do not know the language or pass on medical control .
without understanding of the language , it says S@@ eb@@ ail@@ s , the future immigrant will be condemned to find un@@ scrupulous people who , with the pretext of helping , is a trav@@ el@@ er paid to a de@@ er , and a close @-@ to @-@ date , and dozens of others like him , and dozens of others like him and dozens of others .
we received a number of complaints from our immigrants .
&quot; in his homeland they promise you one thing , but they are dec@@ eived , they are deprived of their passports , they are not paying them the promised wages , &quot; confirms the chief of the immigration Directorate of immigration services , To@@ li@@ b Sh@@ ari@@ po@@ v .
I don &apos;t know .
however , in the meantime , many citizens of Central Asia who want to work in Russia recognise that not only do they know the country &apos;s language they seek to go , but also in their own written language .
of course , this is not your fault , but its own mis@@ fortune : it is a few tur@@ k@@ less , u@@ z@@ bec@@ os , ta@@ y@@ ik@@ os who can afford normal primary education .
this is because their families even have nothing to do to feed children , not to talk about them already .
when I get to the teen@@ age , these boys are getting to work at the first opportunity .
it is difficult , if the language is not known , they recognise them .
&quot; one feels humili@@ ated and lower . &quot;
however , as regards the law on language , defenders of rights indicate an important point .
the tests will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal .
if they do not have that status , there will be no examination and , consequently , no official work .
meanwhile , most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome or forbidden to strang@@ ers
many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy .
the cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties in the language itself .
in addition , leg@@ alisation costs money : twelve thousand to 16 thousand ru@@ bs .
however , a false wording can be done quickly and for only a thousand hundred ru@@ kes .
Russian police employees know that we usually have fake documents , we are not registered and the cases of extor@@ tion .
&quot; we are asking for a hundred or two ru@@ bs for cigarettes or tea , &quot; comm@@ ented on journalists the citizen of Taj@@ ik@@ istan , U@@ med Hus@@ h@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ ov .
&quot; come on , don &apos;t be tac@@ ly , buy a painting . &quot;
the first day of the entry into force of the law on language , it became apparent that not only the registration documents can be fake .
a number of &apos; false &apos; knowledge certificates of language have already been rel@@ axed by civil service officials .
the falsi@@ fied documents had been printed in standard paint .
of course , they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift : every immigrant , wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests , paid for the document seven thousand ru@@ bs .
this is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure , which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand ru@@ bs .
the main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that the &apos; diplomas &apos; cannot be bought , conver@@ ting government officials and defenders of rights .
until now , the authorities can promise migrant workers that they would not have been able to spend the first time to study the basic course of language .
in addition , immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people .
the Interior Ministry does not take drastic action against illegal arms trade .
the percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low .
the Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigi@@ dity in relation to the use of civil weapons owners .
this is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents : sque@@ eze shots for wedding celebr@@ ations in which fortunately there was no victims , and the massacre initiated by the British lawyer Dimi@@ tri V@@ ino@@ gr@@ á@@ do@@ v , in which A@@ pre@@ ar seven people lost their lives .
the police want to ban the use and possession of trau@@ matic weapons in public places and to raise the minimum age for the purchase of weapons , 18 years to 21 years .
this idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on the security and fight against corruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ ar@@ ov@@ aya , who promised that the reforms on the possession of arms will be carried out to the State Duma in the near future .
not everyone feels happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter@@ act this problem by applying the &apos; tough policy &apos; .
in the network , an open letter has appeared , whose authors , representatives of various social organisations in the sho@@ oter , demand that such measures be dis@@ charged with &apos; no meaningless &apos; measures .
the percentage of acts of v@@ and@@ alism with the use of registered weapons is minimal , comm@@ ented on the BBC news of Russia , the criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ li@@ y L@@ esar .
according to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior , for six months of 2012 , there were 142 crimes with the use of fire@@ arms registered in the interior bodies , against the total of 1@@ 16@@ 8 crimes registered for this same period .
the authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the civil use sector will not be a problem for the criminal to address the black market .
now , according to your words , in Moscow , any weapon can be found under price .
meanwhile , in the Ministry of the Interior , the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control .
suppliers : from factories to officers
the black arms market is supplied through several channels .
the main channels are years , he says Colonel V@@ í@@ c@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets , who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High State .
on the screen of the website that accepts the orders of weapons
the first , &quot; the army of the army or military , &quot; that is , the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus .
&quot; the weapons were hur@@ d@@ led by Russian officers and for the same seas@@ onal , &quot; says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
the next type of &apos; black weapon &apos; , stolen by criminals and representatives of security forces .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that there are the hur@@ ried weapons of police war@@ ehouse and those stolen directly by officials from enforcement bodies .
illegal weapons go out to sale from military ar@@ als .
in many military cof@@ fers there was often explo@@ sions .
&quot; there are proven versions that some fires were caused by pre@@ medi@@ t@@ antly to cover the &apos; , eat an ex@@ military .
according to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the arms manufacturers also put their sand on sand .
&quot; now there have been private weapons of weapons that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the black market , including Moscow &apos; , says the expert .
one more source of the black market is smuggling .
large numbers of guns and guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan .
&quot; there you have their own production , sometimes arti@@ san@@ al , and a mafia has been formed that has organised the flow of arms , &quot; explains the ex @-@ military .
where are the weapons coming from ?
the experts have calculated the involvement of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market .
a report on this subject was drawn up in 2011 by the Centre for the analysis and planning of public management .
the specialists looked at reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Ros@@ esco , biometric liter@@ ature and public access data of port@@ als whose fear is around weapons .
the vast majority of illegal weapons , according to researchers , come from the armed forces and security forces .
half the weapons of the black market have come there because of officials whose work is related to arms , it is said in the report .
according to researchers , 17 % of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts , 14 % of cases were broken in the production of arms and 5 % corresponds to the &apos; illegal ar@@ cha@@ ology &apos; .
dependent on one of the arms shops , who asked for his name not to be mentioned , says that the weapons found by illegal exc@@ av@@ ators are not buying them for a long time because they are too old .
more often , it says , suppliers are heading for military war@@ ehouse when they need a game .
through some sign , the supplier buy a unit , for example a T@@ T pist@@ ol .
they remove them from the register and pass over the fence .
&quot; this leads the weapon to the city and sell it to EUR 900 by unit with two ship@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , the police are in the process of all the issues , so perio@@ dic@@ ally , when the discovery plan is to be met , they carry out evidence for illegal arms traders , including the dependent .
&quot; as in a luxury bou@@ ti@@ que . &quot;
the vend@@ or and the bu@@ yer are usually through known .
&quot; I visited websites and b@@ log@@ s until a guy who proposed me to be to the &quot; Be@@ go@@ va &quot; platform , where I would be a man who would take me to a &quot; 5 &quot; where we could negotiate .
the price of the gun , I heard only there . &quot;
military comm@@ entary Vik@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets
&quot; to get a weapon I need a friend who has contacts , &quot; says the size of the store . &quot; I have a friend like that , but I don &apos;t really trust him . &quot;
in the markets there are sel@@ lers , but there is also a need to come , say &quot; part of Mr Iv@@ ano@@ vi@@ h , who asked him to tell him that he had a tooth to his daughter . &quot;
I can even get a couple of steel blan@@ kets through a person of confidence .
he also supplies me to myself because he knows I &apos;m not going to del@@ ve him .
the new ones are looking for weapons of different ways .
the former Vik@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets was tested on the role of illegal arms bu@@ yers in the middle of the 1990s , when it was available to publish an article on this subject .
the bur@@ ns , according to their words , have not changed .
they gave him a photo al@@ bum where there was no &quot; everything . &quot;
&quot; I felt like a luxury bou@@ ti@@ que , &quot; remember the military .
the bu@@ yer , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets , does not give him a cat for li@@ t@@ ches : everything that is possible .
I , as a potential client , not just buy ; we go with the sel@@ ler , where we put a target .
&quot; give me the opportunity to shoot and when I assure you that the weapon is right , we started negotiating &apos; , describes the expert .
silver store
the Internet search engines lead to sites and groups of &quot; V@@ k@@ on@@ tak@@ te &apos; , where it is offered to buy arms for different purposes . &quot;
for this , no personal documents or meetings are required .
&quot; it is enough to have a certain amount of money &apos; , write in the adverti@@ sement of the Com@@ pr@@ icu@@ ous warning to a gun or a gun machine . &quot;
users make their orders and put questions .
and they sell minors ?
&quot; without permission , of course , question to the user &quot; Ivan .

Vik@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets says that if a line is made in line , one is left without a weapon and put it in jail .

the employees of rapid food restaur@@ ants and super@@ markets in the US
up to a quarter of American teen@@ ag@@ ers find their first jobs as machines in &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s &quot;
in the last few days , in the United States , a wave of protests against low wages paid in the super@@ markets of Wal@@ mar@@ t corpor@@ ation and the restaur@@ ants of rapid food chains , such as &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s &quot; , such as &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s &quot; , such as &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s &quot; , such as &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s &quot; , &quot; B@@ urg@@ er King &quot; , &quot; B@@ urg@@ er King &quot; , &quot; B@@ urg@@ er King &apos; , &quot; B@@ urg@@ er King &apos; , &quot; &quot;
for now , no one dares to say whether or not there will be this wave to nine points , or whether it has to lose forces and am@@ bush in its first stages .
the protest actions count on the support of trade unions and a number of left @-@ wing NGOs .
in addition to the increase in the modest wages paid by Wal@@ mar@@ t &apos;s workers and the rapid food system , the aim of the organis@@ ers of the protests is the creation of trade unions in these companies .
for now , this sector of the economy has not been occupied by the trade union movement .
fourth and six cents a year ?
the actions began last week , after the day of Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , the &apos; Black Black &apos; .
that day , some of the Wal@@ mar@@ t corpor@@ ation workers , which employ 2.@@ 2 million people in the world , abandoned their jobs and formed pe@@ anu@@ ts , together with the trade unions and left activists in corporate shops , whose products are directed to people of modest income and moderate .
Wal@@ mar@@ t sel@@ ls everything , from di@@ aper@@ s , hunting guns and batteries for cars , even aspir@@ ers , eggs and milk .
products in their shops are at average between 8 % and 27 % cheaper than those of the larger super@@ markets .
that is why many poorly paid workers from Wal@@ mar@@ t buy only work .
the availability and sur@@ fing of products have made Wal@@ mar@@ t one of the largest corporations in America .
according to the words two critics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell products to very low prices , partly because they pay little to their workers .
the latter also complain about the bad working conditions , such as the lack of mon@@ tac@@ ar@@ gas or hand scan@@ ners .
that Black V@@ ier@@ nes , the participants in the demonstration demanded the increase in wages and compl@@ ained that the cost of health insurance provided by corpor@@ ation has passed from 30 to 100 monthly monthly .
for a typical worker of Wal@@ mar@@ t , who receives $ 9@@ .5 per hour , this expenditure is excessive , they said .
scientists from the University of California in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t increases the average wage until 12 per hour , this will cost the body 3.@@ 2 billion .
this is about 1.@@ 1 % more than it spend@@ s in wages now .
if Wal@@ mar@@ t puts the wage increase in consumer shoulders , every visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive .
in a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $ 12@@ .@@ 39 more than they spend now .
Mrs Wal@@ mar@@ t &apos;s supporters are pleased that the protest took place only in nine states and which did not cause any loss of corpor@@ ation .
the Black V@@ ier@@ nes is prolong@@ ed in its shops since 8 p.m. afternoon until midnight at midnight , and during that time Wal@@ mar@@ t sold around 5@@ 000 articles .
in total , its boxes registered the Black V@@ ier@@ nes , almost 100 million transactions .
the representative of the company , Dan F@@ og@@ el@@ man , stated in an interview at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Po@@ st website , which left its job &apos; less than five &apos; employees of Wal@@ mar@@ t and that the protest had not been more than &quot; another trick of public relations , &quot; organised by the labour union .
&quot; free cut ! &quot;
the protests continued this week in New York , in which the objectives were not exactly the big war@@ ehouse of Wal@@ mar@@ t , which in this progressive city have no appreciation of them , and that is why there is no one , but the &apos; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s &apos; and other cheap restaur@@ ants .
Mc@@ Donald &apos;s says he sel@@ ls billions of por@@ tions , and then they don &apos;t even give you the low disease and do not pay for your honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Williams , member of the New York Council of New York
now , according to the federal law and New York , minimum wage is EUR 7@@ .@@ 25 per hour .
fast food restaur@@ ants are going to increase it with time , but only slightly , and half , ordinary workers receive $ 8@@ .@@ 90 per hour .
nobody wins less than they in this town .
how is it possible to survive in New York with that money , for me it is incomprehensible .
there was a time when almost the fourth part of American teen@@ ag@@ ers went through Mc@@ Donald &apos;s and worked there , behind the people , part @-@ time after school , even though they still lived with their parents .
few were those who saw this as the main source of income or plan to stay there long .
now , in a number of inter@@ views with Mc@@ Donald &apos;s workers who complain that they have to live in this salary , and sometimes even feeding their children .
on the other hand , in a magazine of the Wall Street Journal , there is a comment which points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them .
the participants in the protests , which began at 6 : 30 a.m. tomorrow in the Mc@@ Donald &apos;s 4@@ 0@@ th Street and Mad@@ ison Aven@@ ue , demanded that they have to be paid for at least 15 per hour or so that they are being paid for their current minimum wages .
they also demanded that workers in the fast food sector believe trade unions .
the US law prohib@@ its the administration to prevent this right and punish the activists of trade union movements with an argument and redundancies .
on the other hand , the administration is rarely making it easier for them .
but for objective reasons , it is easy for trade unions to cover the food sector .
one of the main is the excessive ro@@ tation of staff .
dis@@ cord
the same day in other cheap restaur@@ ants of Man@@ hattan .
the culmin@@ ation of action took place in the middle of the mi@@ tin in Mc@@ Donald &apos;s located near Times Squ@@ are , in which a number of local democrats were involved , in particular the member of the M@@ uni@@ an Council of Jud@@ ge , who said : &quot; Mc@@ Donald &apos;s says that he is selling billions of por@@ tions , &quot; and he does not even give you a hospital .
the demonstrators received the support of other prominent democrats from New York , for example the candidate of the mayor Bill of Bl@@ asi@@ o , who said that &quot; we must support the workers of the rapid food sector so that they can get fair wages and economic prosperity that is worthy of each neo @-@ k@@ ino . &quot;
as the New York Times has described , this has been the greatest demonstration of this kind in the American history of fast food .
but in her only a few hundred people were involved , even not all of them were employees of the rapid food service , in which there are tens of thousands of people in New York .
it is not yet clear whether this will make a huge contribution to a massive movement .
&quot; for now , cheating on the brain is not so easy . &quot;
the issue of the reality increased , as popular among the amat@@ eur@@ s to modern technologies , is mainly perceived by the correspond@@ ence of special glasses .
at the beginning of the summer , at its annual conference Google showed a model in movement and subsequently , in November , it was known that Micro@@ soft had presented a request to claim the corresponding patent .
however , from a conversation with the head of the Inter@@ active technology group 3@@ D in Cam@@ bridge &apos;s Sy@@ soft lab , Iz@@ adi Shar@@ am@@ om , it was watered down that for the scientists of that company , glasses already belong@@ ed to a last stage .
they attract the prospect of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of open sp@@ aces .
- Please , in general terms , what is the study of your investigation group ?
we are dedicated to the inter@@ computer interaction , but we are trying to extend the limits of this interaction .
for now , humanity in its great mass has been trapped at the working time with the pills of the flat screen , sometimes it touches on the finger .
but we want to look at 5 @-@ 10 years ahead and guess the car@@ din@@ al changes in this interaction .
for example , the X@@ box X@@ box and the Kin@@ ec@@ t sen@@ sors represent a step forward and today no X@@ box is sold without Kin@@ ec@@ t , as everyone is interested in the control by g@@ es@@ ps .
- What else are we stopping the future ?
in spite of the fact that Kin@@ ec@@ t has taken the interaction at physical level , a large part of this is still in a flat screen , sometimes in 3@@ D .
the introduction of information has improved ( the system more data ) , and the exit is still not very good .
we are trying to change this , we are working in a truly tri@@ dimensional fashion system , based on different technologies , including those of design .
the information world must be released to our , physical , to do more tangible .
for this , however , it is necessary to recognise not only the user , but also the space surrounding it .
then we can complete the real world with virtu@@ al objects in a more comfortable way .
first of all , to the devil with these virtual fuc@@ kers !
- What do you think about the voice control ?
a very popular detail , but do you not think you over@@ estimate it ?
- Of course it cannot be considered a panacea , it is pending to resolve the question of privacy , because it is not always the case that others are involved in our actions and intentions .
in fact , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own field .
for example , for the control of devices in public places , we had a project in which we think of the gest@@ ures , but not loose movements , but shorter .
in addition , the gest@@ ures were cap@@ tured not by the camera of the device , but for a br@@ acel@@ et that regul@@ ates the movement of bones and mus@@ cles .
it is now very big , but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a lun@@ g watch .
but , in general , the future is for a combined type of control , for example .
- How is that ?
- For example , how would you ask me to give you this so@@ da ?
you will speak and show it at the same time .
- I just speak .
- Oh , that will be very difficult to recognise .
so , you want to force users to adapt to what can or cannot do at this time the machine ?
- Not necessarily , but it is a mutual approach .
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new sen@@ sors that can determine the reactions of the person .
these can be , for example , las@@ ers , as they provide a good resolution , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with the sen@@ sors of X@@ box Kin@@ ec@@ t , what complaints do you have from the modern cameras ?
do you have a resolution , depth or something else ?
in principle , the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the tri@@ dimensional recognition .
of course , it would be good to get 8 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ els at the speed of 1000 f@@ ports .
but the question is not in the me@@ tals , but in the quality of the ma@@ tri@@ x and in depth .
from this last point of view , all current technologies are not good enough for us ; this gives more work to the alg@@ ori@@ sts of alg@@ ori@@ ms .
I mean , we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and , but also in Z@@ .
it is also important for the speed , the number of blocks .
human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 f@@ ports are really scarce , especially for the g@@ es@@ les .
Steven B@@ ath@@ ic@@ I , from our lab in Red@@ mond , made a sense of contact with re@@ tail@@ able re@@ processing of 1 to 100 , and that the modern sen@@ sors produced in seri@@ al number are closer to the second value ( 60 @-@ 100 ) .
not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of human @-@ machine interaction .
I would be very helpful to my work for an equivalent of such a device , but it does not require contact for the second to be more .
- And it is not necessary to increase the number of cameras ?
- The Kin@@ ec@@ t has three &apos; cameras &apos; now , one of which is in fact the in@@ surg@@ ent detention station and the second recipient of the signal reflected .
but the third chamber is actually a simple sens@@ or of the visible di@@ ap@@ as@@ on .
this is not used to determine the depth of the subject .
potentially , more of cameras could solve the problem ...
or on the contrary , it increases and acc@@ entu@@ ate the required amount of calculations .
it would be good to create a flexible analy@@ st of Kin@@ ec@@ t , to play with the cur@@ v@@ ature of the cameras and see how this would help to determine the tri@@ dimensional position .
as far as I remember , Micro@@ soft , unlike Google , he has not presented his glasses to the public .
does it not seem that , from the point of view of the daily use of reality , the glasses are one of the most visible platforms ?
- Of course , to spend all the time holding a smart phone in the hands , it is not very comfortable , but I think : the best option would be a reality increased &apos; trans@@ mu@@ table &apos; when , on the basis of a cloud of cloud , you could move from the bright phone .
the glasses are very personal devices , in that it is their strength ( private stuff only you can see ) , but also its weakness : a reality that is increased based on the virtu@@ es not to work on virtual objects together with other people .
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of totalitarian objects in the air is available not only for Tony Star@@ k of the &quot; Iron Man &quot; film , but also for any simple mortal .
there is a problem in this idea that critics often point out : no tac@@ tical response !
hands don &apos;t feel anything !
what answers does your group prepare for this challenge ?
in my conferences I often say that the reality is the seventh in@@ rup@@ tion in the interaction between the man and the machine .
I think the eigh@@ th well could be the addition of tac@@ tical sens@@ ations .
meanwhile , one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image .
put the t@@ act down perfectly !
but there are also technologies that are really geared to bringing about these &apos; images in the air &apos; .
there are also thu@@ mb@@ s for the wri@@ st that influ@@ ences the nervous termin@@ ations of the fingers , that is also a promising address .
- Have you tried to fool the brain ?
do you think he feels what he looks like at the time he sees something ?
- That is a good idea , we have not yet tried .
there is another challenge here with which we will have to fight for a long time , how to make a person physically located in a very small area creates that it is going to an open space , and we are also working on the idea of the tap@@ es , and we are also working on the idea of the tap@@ es .
for now , cheating on the brain is not so easy , we still have to work for many years .
that is what makes work attractive to the virtual reality for researchers , which many things are in a state of complete conception .
I would like to express my personal pleasure rather than culture .
&quot; Ros@@ bal@@ t &apos; continues the &apos; San Peters@@ burg &apos; project , dedicated to the citizens who are in front of the art of art and culture .
in this list of the best you find the art of the art and the St Peters@@ burg scene , whose achievements come beyond the city : they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them .
the new hero of &quot; Ros@@ bal@@ t &quot; is the ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant artist Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller .
the whole city is familiar with Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller , a bar@@ bed man from upstairs , which can be found near the Mu@@ se@@ o R@@ uso , near the Ver@@ ano de Ver@@ ano or in fashion meetings .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller &apos;s pa@@ int@@ ings always attract multi@@ tude , wherever they are showing .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller is one of those purely socio @-@ philo@@ sop@@ otic cu@@ s@@ sors of San Peters@@ burg , cre@@ ators of new my@@ th@@ log@@ s .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller is a brilliant representative of the San Peters@@ burg van@@ age at the end of the 80 - principles of 90 .
in addition , it is an urban man , whose appearance in the streets of the city wake up in the people &apos;s lives and is up to all the state of mind .
recently , it took a organis@@ er and became the organis@@ er of St Peters@@ burg , since it has grown to make it so difficult , for its existence , its philosophy and its image .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , why are you going for the city of red and not yellow , for example ?
I did the red color because I am a fashion desig@@ ner and I am looking at the appearance and the image .
in this world , the red color is a compromise between the artist , the cre@@ ators of images and the society .
although in society , everything that is not a little grey raises aggressive and thri@@ ving proper@@ ties .
but my provoc@@ ations are directed at a conversation .
the whole story of my provoc@@ ative actions is an invitation to the debate .
- When did you understand that you should be an artist ?
- In an exhibi@@ tion of the Culture N@@ ev@@ sky Pal@@ ace , where my work was displayed .
I realized that was my way .
then the wave of old non @-@ official artists had finished , and the new , free as me , were still un@@ understood .
I made a friend of artists from the new wave , with the subsequent ones that were exposed in Gaza and N@@ ev@@ ski@@ y , which led to &quot; P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ aya @-@ 10 &quot; and the new wave is over .
I was in the theatre for the clothes , the music of all the g@@ ents , but not for the letters .
- And all of this came together in your art C@@ ly@@ ic - for me it was important to find me at the cultural centre of San Peters@@ burg , where the best creative minds were to be brought together .
in 1995 , I played a territory in P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ aya @-@ 10 and there , while there was no reforms , there was a music club , a wedding club , the wedding house , the house of St Peters@@ burg .
many were born there : N@@ oms , T@@ equi@@ la J@@ az@@ z , I remember the way in which sar@@ ur brought the project to the &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; project .
sar@@ ur and his friends were singing light songs under plu@@ mb@@ o@@ gram , they were wearing tight pants , including the I@@ g@@ or @-@ V@@ do@@ vin fashion .
when the group started to play in alive , it became &apos; Len@@ ing@@ rad . &quot;
Tr@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg was encouraging many programmes before H@@ ali @-@ g@@ ali@@ v@@ sky .
we gave Tr@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg and was the beginning of his great career ; basic education and training received it from us .
&quot; D 137 &quot; , the &quot; Gri@@ th@@ th@@ ov Club , are the remains of the C@@ ly@@ ic &apos; .
there were our employees and customers .
I am a hero of the last century , when culture meant something .
in the year 2000 , the survey was made in the press , the prize was &quot; The people of our city . &quot;
in the nomination of the Year &apos; Ar@@ ti@@ st , I was elected , that was my culmin@@ ation .
in these new times it is not comfortable to work ; I am a man who likes the truth , honesty and the culture of the last century .
in our times it is easy to make popular , but culture and popu@@ lar@@ ity are separate .
- There is something in your business .
- many of my pa@@ int@@ ings are , in these cases , a very clear one , and the fact is that it is .
I &apos;m going to make a program@@ med statement , &quot; The Mu@@ se@@ o R@@ uso in clo@@ as@@ os . &quot;
clo@@ as@@ os are an in@@ tim@@ al category .
I was soci@@ able , but now it is painful and terri@@ fying .
but in the clo@@ ts everything gets drunk and the tragedy is removed .
I love the gro@@ tes@@ que , I have gro@@ tes@@ que ideas .
for example , the salv@@ ation of the world by a totalitarian and compulsory exchange of clothes .
now you are still on the clothes , focusing on external , but not inside the person .
and maybe that person is not supposed to give him the hand , but he sp@@ it on his face .
and decep@@ tion will be eliminated when it changes .
we saw you recently in the role of urban organis@@ er .
who better than me to be !
- Well , maybe the commercial art can be beautiful ?
now , the commercial art must be scrupulous , sweet , having an act .
we are witnessing the dis@@ integration of cultures .
first of all , people were together in man@@ ads , the balls wanted one thing , the go@@ ons .
now all have been divided into micro @-@ communities , it is difficult to meet everyone .
I &apos;m not a 100 bucks ticket to like them all .
now we need to think of who you want .
now , every hero of wor@@ ship has his 100 fans .
- And to listen to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ i@@ lov arrive for thousands !
- They are going to see the abandoned , the social @-@ social sphere .
and a cultural event is 300 people , 10 thousand will never come .
I have my fans , the most important thing is not to dec@@ eive them , not to lose what you have achieved .
when I was young he made such pa@@ int@@ ings that a collec@@ tor had hung up on the wall beside Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov .
I started pa@@ ints , with which people usually end .
now they often confuse concepts .
they say spiritual culture , consumer culture .
there is no culture in consumption , that is another story .
I am a man of yesterday &apos;s culture , I grew up under the example of artists living in poverty and died in poverty , denied money only to paint pa@@ int@@ ings .
I am in favour of this culture .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , what &apos;s missing from San Peters@@ burg ?
- Good experts in culture .
there is a concept : culture of culture .
but not all of them can go to culture .
when the re@@ ings were the right thing to do , the re@@ ings might not be very well understood by culture , but they knew it was necessary to maintain the right experts .
in Moscow now there are very good consul@@ tants .
we have people in St Peters@@ burg who could be experts , but they are closed , because they need experts at a higher level than to properly evaluate these and open them up .
it is now thri@@ ving personal taste .
the same Er@@ ar@@ ta , but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted , there are some artists who have to look for other muse@@ ums .
- What is it for you Saint Peters@@ burg ?
- St Peters@@ burg is not a cultural capital , in Moscow there is much more culture , there is ground .
but on our stones it is difficult for art to grow .
we need cultural ground and we now have more wri@@ ters than read@@ ers , this is wrong .
in Europe there is a lot of people with curi@@ osity that it is going to ex@@ positions and con@@ s .
in our case , this type is in@@ f@@ onic .
we need to make art fit , as it was at the beginning of the last century .
the project will be implemented with an aid of St Peters@@ burg .
give birth in space
the Earth is in danger .
global warming or shock with an aster@@ o@@ id killer .
car@@ av@@ ans of space ships with human beings on board are looking for a planet of re@@ post .
to preserve humanity is the main question : how will we continue the kind in conditions of immense life or on the same planet of re@@ post ?
I think there &apos;s little to choose .
in fact , only two are real plan@@ ets that can be colon@@ ised , at least hypo@@ the@@ tically .
&quot; these are Ven@@ us and Mar@@ te &apos; , he says the chief investig@@ ator of the Cul@@ tural Institute to , S@@ tern@@ berg P.@@ K. ( IA@@ ES ) , Vladi@@ mir Sur@@ din .
but if the conditions in Mar@@ s are better for life , in the surface of Ven@@ us the temperature is of 500 degrees .
we can only live in great al@@ tit@@ des or in Ven@@ us &apos;s or@@ bit .
the problems of re@@ production in the space with flora began .
it &apos;s been a half a century since experiments were carried out .
four generations of gu@@ is@@ ers cultiv@@ ated in or@@ bit didn &apos;t differ from the land vari@@ eties .
then the breeding of insec@@ ts in the or@@ bit , small flies of fruit , dru@@ ms .
in 1979 , they were sent to the egg @-@ sleep area to check how the embr@@ yo is developing in conditions of mass .
we get a normal baby .
but then the problems begin .
&quot; the problem is that this baby has to find support , it must be maintained on its own feet and start moving &apos; , &quot; explains Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ ch@@ ev , the director of the lab of the Cri@@ me Institute in Russia .
not to find support , the chic@@ ks gave birth to random .
and after 10 hours in the new@@ born new@@ born , there was a total outbreak of the inst@@ inc@@ ts .
chic@@ ks didn &apos;t react to the light or sound .
and the disgrace was that after four days just died .
&quot; and two times we get the chic@@ ks to be born , but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them , com@@ da Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ ch@@ ev on failure of the experiment with the chic@@ ks in space .
the last time a &quot; mini@@ ar@@ ca &quot; came to the or@@ bit was 16 years ago .
in the spring of 2013 , experiments will continue .
however , in the bi@@ os@@ at@@ ini &apos; Bi@@ on &apos; , they will only travel species of a same sex .
there was an experiment with r@@ ats , which were sent to space with ugly .
in principle , nothing was found .
&quot; this was precisely in the shops , but this was a unique experiment , and studies such as this must be carried out , com@@ da Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ ch@@ ev .
after landing , space r@@ ats had off@@ spring .
however , it has not yet been managed to deal with the problem of re@@ production directly in space .
it is a difficult challenge .
animals , losing their usual habit@@ at , simply cannot do their sexual inst@@ inct .
the man , however , unlike the small animals , in principle , can .
Hom@@ o s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens has the abstr@@ act reasoning and it is capable of creating an appropriate emotional fund .
similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons .
but women travel to space for 50 years .
the greatest risk has happened by Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va .
and the most precious thing that mankind has is the female body .
our g@@ av@@ ace flying , and nobody in the Earth could say : if it is after a flight to space .
it can or will not have a baby after this flight .
&quot; after all , to this question no one has answered &apos; , com@@ mits the veter@@ an of V@@ akh@@ tan@@ g V@@ ach@@ swim@@ ze V@@ ach@@ swimming .
in June 196@@ 4 , only after a year of flight to space , the first woman , Valent@@ ina Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va , gave birth to a daughter .
the father of the child , An@@ dri@@ an Nik@@ ol@@ ay@@ ev , was also tic@@ k@@ au@@ t .
in 1988 , the second woman re@@ mon@@ au@@ t , S@@ ve@@ t@@ l@@ ana Sav@@ it@@ sk@@ aya , who was twice in or@@ bit and even worked in open space , had a son .
however , the risk remains .
we are few , the astron@@ au@@ ts to those who after long flights have been good , and a healthy generation is growing .
&quot; and if you can say more , it is dangerous even in or@@ bit@@ al flights , &quot; sum@@ mon@@ ed the pilot , the Soviet Union &apos;s hero , hero of Russia , Val@@ ery Pol@@ y@@ ak@@ ov .
however , humanity must seek some new ways in biotechnology , in the radi@@ ological protection , the creation of artificial gravity .
the Centre for the Research Centre for Dru@@ mon@@ au@@ ts is a mandatory stage in preparation for flight .
in terms of flo@@ ating , the cos@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practise their work skills in space .
Syrian water is on the way .
if for an adult , water is a comfortable environment , even though I still fear , for a newly born child is his home element .
small @-@ fashioned men seem to confirm that life in the land came from the ocean .
there is a connection between the fact that the baby finds around 9 months within its mother in liquid liquid , because it will be easier to get used to the water .
in principle , this is logical , because from the time of the birth to the moment of the first bath , only 2 weeks are passed .
&quot; this is very little to forget something &apos; , it says Marina Ak@@ sen@@ o@@ va , a regular monitoring of new@@ born .
in short , if the ing@@ ra@@ vi@@ dity is a more natural state for a new@@ born , for women is necessary , the strength of gravity .
the mus@@ cle mus@@ cles and the pel@@ vis @-@ in @-@ law are very fast , the ability of the fe@@ tus is reduced .
well , we om@@ itted that , trust@@ ing the promotion action for child@@ birth .
you can , of course , give birth to a special camera , this will push it .
&quot; and then what ? &quot;
on the other hand , the child also needs artificial gravity .
without the feeling of gravity , the body does not create the sk@@ el@@ et@@ et or the mus@@ cle system .
a new@@ born born in or@@ bit is impossible to dress with a special suit for training , like adults .
it will simply be deprived of what is vital for him .
&quot; and this experiment we are going to do together , by allowing the birth of a child in a strange atmosphere , will give rise to the Earth to a disabled , to a completely un@@ adapted person , to a completely un@@ adapted person &apos; , it provides for the head of the bio @-@ ethics committee of the Cul@@ tural Institute in Russia , I@@ g@@ or P@@ est@@ ov .
for now , the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue .
however , in time this will be a reality , when human beings in their ships are heading to a distant planet that will be home for their children born in space .
chief of N@@ K@@ UK@@ : the inspection of the &quot; Ser@@ var@@ c &quot; system has not given the politician guilty .
in the field of public procurement , the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation , even though its application is co@@ lli@@ de .
it says that Mi@@ los@@ lav K@@ ala , Vice @-@ President of the Supreme Office ( N@@ K@@ DA ) in an interview for Ak@@ tu@@ al@@ n@@ al@@ .@@ cz@@ .
&quot; the law will never be perfect &apos; , but its implementation must be correct . &quot; this is , in my opinion , what we lack &apos; , so describes the current situation .
the joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions .
as an example of incorrect practice , it mentions Pe@@ bán Ne@@ č@@ as &apos;s attitude to the system of being self @-@ employed only on paper , which is known as the &apos; š@@ var@@ c &apos; system .
the first minister said recently that the O@@ DS ( Christian Democratic Party ) would not bother employers with inspectors , then is it forbidden or allowed ?
&quot; the law must be regulated in some way and if it prohib@@ its something , in that case , neither the President of the government can prevent the action of the office that has the obligation to carry out these controls or to demand obligations &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; , &quot; K@@ ala .
at the meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , you spoke of the joint project between the Czech team and the German , within the framework of which the legislation relating to public procurement in both countries .
what exactly is it ?
it is a parallel control that we started to make a couple of years ago .
in a simpli@@ fied manner , the European legislation regul@@ ates how public procurement should be organised , this is still the legislation in force in each country and then the practice in itself .
we have united everything and , although control has not yet been completed , we have had very interesting differences , generally , the legislation of our country is &apos; stricter and more complete &apos; , but the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany .
it is confirmed , therefore , that it is not enough to incorporate more stringent rules , but it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself .
what can this project actually do ?
it is precisely a common control of this type that could help us to invest in the concrete efforts of the laws , reducing and improving the limits , although this does not have such a positive impact .
the savings economy means achieving a reasonable price for a reasonable price ( what does not always mean that price is the lowest ) to avoid the enrich@@ ment and , in the long run , criminal actions .
but not by the fact that the recei@@ pt limit is to be reduced , means that we will achieve it .
perhaps because the system is over@@ crow@@ ded with &apos; paperwork &apos; , which those who want to find failures in the system can make it easier to do so than if the limits were kept so high now .
you talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement .
how does the system of controls work in Germany ?
is it a similar office to our N@@ K@@ UK@@ or is it organised differently ?
as far as the offices are concerned , such as N@@ K@@ DA , there is the Bun@@ des@@ des@@ n@@ un@@ ch of the Federal Court of Auditors , with a similar organisation to our own , with a similar college , with a college , as well as the only one in which it is structured in a different way .
the powers are also to a certain extent analy@@ zed , however , as Germany has a federal organisation , the courts of accounts are even at this level .
the Federal Court of Auditors ( BR@@ H ) can only control federal money , which we call state funds .
public funds , which are administered by the regions and municip@@ alities , in Germany , are controlled in the Federal Court of Auditors .
as for local legislation , is it simpler than ours ?
generally speaking , I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data , but Germany is still a model in some respects , but it cannot be clarified exactly what is better .
could it be better , for example , on the quality of inspectors ?
that sure , but I repeat , I don &apos;t like to make this kind of compar@@ is@@ ons .
it is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems .
if it wasn &apos;t like that , it would not be any benefit to work with our office , do you think ?
with regard to the legislation of our country , what did it mean for the office of the law on public procurement ?
given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short , it has not yet been expressed in the control actions .
since we carry out ex post checks , we need to have a certain delay .
for now , it is observed in the process of preparing future controls : we have launched a new tool of &apos; non @-@ economic risk detection &apos; , which we have done almost 14@@ ,000 public procurement , which has been analysed , and the changes will be made perfectly clear here , as the changes are being made to the end of the process .
do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial or that , rather , it is a mess for the bureaucratic system ?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that it will be .
the problem that may arise is that the rules &apos; are strengthened &quot; and that it is impossible to fulfil it .
with the previous regulations , the people controlled were linked to the contr@@ actor ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes in the regional council ) , and every law not respected on public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline .
does it make sense then to tighten up the law in this way ?
I think not in this way .
the system must exclude those who want to attack it or exploit it and not punish those who make a formal judgment , which does not have any impact on decision @-@ making .
a system of this kind will only create a greater bureaucratic pressure .
and how does it get out of this ?
we will see where this path is taking us .
the first minister has recently stated that the O@@ DS would not bother employers with controls from the so @-@ called diplomatic system , with reference to being self @-@ employed only on paper .
is the Slovenian system banned or permitted ?
the law must be regulated in some way , and if it prohib@@ its anything , then not even the prime minister of the government can prevent the action of the Office that has the obligation to carry out these controls and demand obligations .
you can say : &quot; we change the law and we allow it , but it cannot say that we will do nothing .
in the law on public procurement , the regulation is quite strict in terms of how to act formally .
but , on the other hand , it is tragic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer for not meeting formal requirements .
the law will never be perfect , but its implementation must be correct .
the roads are pl@@ ates of ice , even though they are transi@@ table .
in several places of the Czech Republic , roads are on ice and snow plate .
although the majority of the tracks are transi@@ table , the caution must be extreme .
region of Kar@@ lov@@ y V@@ ary
today the roads in the Kar@@ lov@@ y region in the Kar@@ lov@@ and V@@ ary region were transi@@ table , but they were on ice and snow grounds .
the temperature goes down and will go through five and ten degrees below zero .
he has stopped denying in the region and in the low ground the snow layer is fin@@ ite .
on the other hand , in the cr@@ acks of the Met@@ á@@ lic@@ al Mon@@ tes , snow is almost 30 c@@ enti@@ metres .
in some places the visibility was still bad cause of the fo@@ g , according to the information of the road management centre of the region .
the rapid R@@ 6 and the first @-@ class road in the region are now transi@@ table without restrictions .
however , it is recommended to be extremely cautious , especially in some bridges whose surface can be frozen and res@@ ili@@ ci@@ ent .
similarly , all the second and third @-@ thirds routes , including mountain roads .
however , in some of them , there is still a tr@@ ay of ice and snow .
attention must be paid to the road , especially in the highest areas .
region of Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice and H@@ r@@ adec
in some of the East Bo@@ hem@@ ia roads there is a danger of freezing and in higher areas and in the mountains , a snow layer has been set up in the tracks , reporting on their pages the road map and motorways .
road oper@@ atives warn drivers about the danger that they are being formed , especially in higher areas of the Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice region .
they may be frozen in Lan@@ š@@ k@@ ro@@ un &apos;s immediate , single n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ é , Poli@@ č@@ ky , S@@ vit@@ av , S@@ vit@@ av or V@@ y@@ so@@ k@@ é@@ ho , and especially on the second and third roads .
the roads I / 43 and I / 34 in S@@ vit@@ av have been treated chemical .
there is a particular snow on the roads of the Kr@@ k@@ on@@ o@@ š@@ e mountains to Or@@ lic@@ k@@ é H@@ ory .
there is an ap@@ is@@ ised snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in Ry@@ ch@@ lan n@@ ad K@@ n@@ al@@ ž@@ n@@ ou and Tru@@ t@@ æ@@ n@@ ou .
in the Eastern Bo@@ hem@@ ia area , the sky will be clear today and partially nu@@ red , without rush .
the dark temper@@ atures generally between three under zero and a positive degree will be a weak wind .
Pil@@ sen region
the roads in the Pil@@ sen region are transi@@ table today by the morning , although the caution and will need to be adapted in time .
in the first hours of tomorrow , there will be fro@@ g , dark temper@@ atures between three and nine degrees below zero .
after the ne@@ v@@ ade and the subsequent decline in temper@@ atures , some ways could also be covered by ice .
in some places , drivers will find themselves with fo@@ g , but visibility will gradually improve .
this is what emerges from the information from the road management centre of the region .
the D@@ 5 motor@@ way is almost un@@ restricted , although it is recommended to be extremely cautious , especially in the way between the 8@@ 0s and 1@@ 31 .
the area of most first @-@ class roads is dry and without ice .
in the area of Pil@@ sen and T@@ ac@@ ho@@ v border and border T@@ ac@@ ho@@ v , there can be ice tr@@ aces .
the second and third category is wet , so , in this case , it is also spe@@ lled out with ice pl@@ ates .
drivers should be more prudent , especially in the less transitional ways in the Š@@ u@@ ma@@ va area .
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
the drivers who address the highest areas of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region will be found in partial snow .
after the chemical treatment , there was still snow in the port of Til@@ er@@ ven@@ o@@ hor@@ é and in the direction to V@@ ide@@ l@@ sk@@ ý k@@ isha .
road oper@@ atives took off the snow during the night ; in the Š@@ um@@ per road , three c@@ enti@@ metres of snow were accumul@@ ated , according to the road managers .
in the rest of the region , most tracks are transi@@ table without restrictions .
&quot; in the highest areas of the road in Š@@ um@@ per , there remains snow remains .
the drivers in the port of Til@@ er@@ ven@@ o@@ o@@ é will be found with a half @-@ way snow in the direction of Jes@@ en@@ í@@ k , he has confirmed an operation of the administration of the Š@@ um@@ per a road administration at the Camp T@@ K .
on the ground and night they came to the Jes@@ en@@ ick@@ á , too , and after the chemical treatment , the routes of the highest areas are now clear and wet .
in the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c road , the tracks are transi@@ table without restrictions , in that of Š@@ tern@@ ber@@ sk@@ á , the drivers should lead with caution in the forest , where the tracks are still wet .
the region of the Single Market and the region of Liber@@ ec
the road operators of the North Bo@@ hem@@ ia have reported about complic@@ ations in different tr@@ aces of the morning .
apart from some places in which it has ne@@ v@@ ed or ice cream , the mountain of the mountain between Tel@@ nice and K@@ nic@@ nice , in the region of the Single Market , is closed .
temper@@ atures are kept under zero , even in the lowest areas , so the ice and snow obviously remain at the bottom @-@ up , in other words in the lowest areas , especially in the area of the Czech central m@@ aci@@ t , there are no problems and roads , and it is generally dry .
there has been no complic@@ ations of service .
road operators have appe@@ aled from the presence of ice in Š@@ t@@ lu@@ ti .
according to the weather , the conditions have been ideal during the night , during the day , the rain is expected and snow , and the sky will be clear and there will be ice .
from the general roads , un@@ favourable conditions have been announced in the road / 13 , on the border between the region of the Single Market and Liber@@ ec .
the road between Tel@@ nice and K@@ nic@@ nice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been put on the road with the weight of snow .
Š@@ im@@ on Or@@ nest : in our concer@@ ts we want to accumul@@ ate positive energy .
it is said that less than a month will be the end of the world , what do you think about it ?
it is only one of so many other reports that we like to catch .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap group we like more well to make jo@@ kes on this and we like to say that we are the only group of music in the world that succeed@@ s enough of the world to bring about the end of the world or to prevent it .
in addition , in December , you have a truly original project : three con@@ forms against the end of the world .
can you explain to our read@@ ers ?
it is a state @-@ friendly act that we have been planning for two years .
we decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the ma@@ iden timetable for 21 December to 11 : 10 in the morning .
the day before , on 20 December at 21 , we will organise three simultan@@ eous con@@ dom@@ s in Prague , Br@@ no and O@@ str@@ ava .
they will end up at the same time in which the ma@@ iden timetable ends in the Ki@@ ri@@ b@@ ati island , in the Pacific Ocean , 12 hours ahead of our area of hor@@ tionary .
who was this idea ?
initially , it was my idea , then we were for@@ ging the project together with our Hon@@ za Au@@ gust@@ er .
in addition to wanting to bring in enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world , we also want to reflect , together with society , on the state on which we will leave the world to our children .
at the end of the ma@@ x calendar we have also created a single collection of articles : bott@@ les , T @-@ shir@@ ts , bags and original cri@@ es against the end of the world that can be acquired in w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ and @-@ c@@ z .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap group , along with other interpreters , also san@@ g the so @-@ called an@@ non against the end of the world , which led by &apos; F@@ in of the world , cancelled &apos; .
it is now very popular in Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , will you be able to hear in the con@@ dom@@ s ?
of course , and it will be fair , well , as long as everything goes well and not over the world ...
they will sing all the interpreters at the same time in the three con@@ s .
the an@@ us will be wrap@@ ped between themselves , thanks to the special re@@ transmission in the Czech Tele@@ vision .
Tom@@ á@@ š Han@@ á@@ k has written the letter of this song and interpre@@ ts the leading role of Jesus in the video video , where X@@ ind@@ l X ...
how did this work come up ?
we are working together with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , apart from organising many ben@@ fying acts and con@@ forms ...
we put all our efforts to participate in this project .
it has been proven that most of them are interested and divided to work with us .
what will the money raise in the con@@ dom@@ s against the end of the world ?
at the centre of the educational centre without Stu@@ deo @-@ free barriers , which we have completed in its sixth consecu@@ tive year with the T@@ ap civil partnership in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ at .
the students in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ynn &apos;s school are regularly receiving the visitors &apos; visit with which they perform fun and interesting activities .
pupils do not have enough economic means to pay for teachers and make it possible to do so .
in the framework of the completion of the works in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ynn , there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project .
in every concert they act several groups and interpreters .
what are the selection criteria ?
we try to draw up a programme that is attractive to all generations , including children .
for example , in Prague they will act Chin@@ as@@ ki , Sup@@ port Les@@ bi@@ ens , I@@ ll@@ us@@ os@@ p@@ here with Dan B@@ ár@@ ta , The T@@ ap T@@ ap , Mari@@ án Ban@@ go and Ji@@ ř@@ í S@@ uc@@ h@@ ý .
to get more detailed information , you can consult w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ k@@ p@@ k@@ s@@ .@@ cz@@ .
do you have any other &apos; spectacular action &apos; in the future ?
in May we will act for the first time in the P@@ ra@@ ž@@ sk@@ é festival , so here we will certainly prepare an attractive programme with interesting guests .
next year , we would like to play in the Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ an National Hall of New York and myself , personally , taking advantage of the fact that we are in the United States , I would like to complete it with action in Washington and Chicago .
your plans abroad are not exactly minim@@ alists , so far you have acted for example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap is , however , a group composed of disabled people .
how is logistics and the organisation of these journeys ?
it &apos;s not so difficult how it looks at first sight .
there are five members of electric whe@@ el@@ chair , the chairs must travel in the compart@@ ment for lu@@ gg@@ age and we have also been very heavy , the boxes with the instruments ...
however , until now we have managed to do well .
even in Moscow , where we have come back recently , everything left without any problems .
thanks to the sal@@ ers abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects .
what did you find up to now ?
in Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other cities , all works better than here ; in Russia we have witnessed that , in the east , there is a long way to go .
unlike Prague , Moscow is full of barriers , there is still no frequent time for a person to leave alone by the centre of the city in a whe@@ el@@ chair .
something such as that is , for example , giving preference to someone on whe@@ el@@ chair , there is not .
luc@@ ki@@ ly , a civil partnership has been created which is endeavouring to fear the problems of disabled people .
what aspects should we take for more advanced countries ?
there are many aspects where we are behind ...
but it is important to mention that perfec@@ tion and improving the situation is always dependent on people directly affected .
in London and in Madrid , it is very normal that people with a serious disability dis@@ regards their own in public and can go to the service , to muse@@ um , where they want ...
but it is not very common for a large number of disabled people to participate in social life actively , in this respect , with the T@@ ap T@@ ap .
an environmentally @-@ friendly society is one thing , but when the time comes when it comes to emin@@ ent sports , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers , will begin to change all truth .
so far , they are isolated cases of people who have a great strength of will .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap group is currently very popular , but if we look at a few years ago , what took you to form the group in 1998 ?
I came in as an educ@@ ator in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ ynn , where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to get to something .
and since I am a musi@@ cian , I play , among others , the sa@@ x@@ offence , founded a amat@@ eur group with a working partner .
and with the time , as our moder@@ ator says to An@@ gel@@ ovi@@ č , we were a little of the hands ( laughter ) .
however , the popu@@ lar@@ ity did not come until the last few years , is it wrong ?
it is true that we helped to connect with famous singer and also actively work to promote the group .
we came to the conclusion that the work that is not seen , it is like it does not exist .
thanks to the European Union &apos;s aid , we can also afford quality teachers , equipment , etc .
did you intend to get so far with The T@@ ap T@@ ap ?
from the beginning I saw the potential that there was , which can be done differently .
the world of show is full of things that resemb@@ les the others .
it is logical , in its way , that all the new things are carefully welcomed and takes long .
there are few extraordinary things , but I dare say that the T@@ ap T@@ ap is one of them .
the impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly the com@@ passion , it is a natural reaction .
but the com@@ passion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned who suffer and which we should have com@@ passion .
there are people who can live a full life and develop , with the condition , of course , that it has the necessary means .
I always say that if something goes well to people with disabilities , then it is not just a step forward for them , but for the whole of society .
did you help the fact that you are a demanding boss , as you describe a lot of people ?
if we want to do quality work , we need to be rigorous in many respects and require some discipline .
I think it is completely normal .
some people arrive with a romantic vision and with the head in the clou@@ ds and when they know they have to go to a rehear@@ sal two days , go to the preparatory test and spend a long time travelling and in con@@ certain , the initial eu@@ for@@ ia .
but that is how it works everywhere , in every group that wants to work and get something .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap group currently has 20 members .
how many of them were already in the year 1998 ?
just one : L@@ á@@ bee to An@@ gel@@ ovi@@ č .
we are an open group , people come inside and get out .
who will have will and will always win open doors
it will be the day before the expected end of the world , Thursday 20@@ .@@ 12.@@ 2012 to 21 p.m.
it will take place in the Ab@@ ch@@ eb@@ a A@@ ren@@ a de Prague , in Br@@ in@@ da de Br@@ un@@ y and Pl@@ y@@ no@@ j@@ em in O@@ str@@ ava and will take 12 groups and other musi@@ ci@@ ans in the Czech Republic .
the three cities will be connected to the end of the evening through video video to sing the song of the T@@ ap T@@ ap T@@ ap .
the aim of the concert is to bring the necessary resources to finance multi @-@ functional equipment of the educational centre without barriers to R@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ at in Prague .
the entry into the concert costs 400 C@@ Z@@ K and children to 12 years have free entry into the early sale option in Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ ati@@ c@@ ket .
Poland and the cos@@ mos .
at the meeting of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week was accepted to Poland as a du@@ o@@ tenth member of the ESA , it is the second Member State of the ESA of the former block of Eastern Europe , after the Czech Republic , which became a full member of November 2008 .
Poland started intensive cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and during the subsequent years involved in the agency &apos;s draft agency .
however , the path of Poland towards the cos@@ mos began a lot earlier .
the Polish enthusiastic people were already dedicated to flights to space before the Second World War , although it was not always their work .
I would like , for example , to see , for example , the United States &apos; E@@ ven@@ fel@@ fel@@ d Observ@@ atory at the War@@ saw Observ@@ atory in which , on 6 December 19@@ 33 , it presented its ideas on the pion@@ eering study . &quot;
the ideas of the young engine@@ er ( born 19@@ 05 ) left the prisoners indifferent and , years later , Š@@ tern@@ fel@@ d remembered that Dr. Jan G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work .
in 19@@ 34 Ver@@ tern@@ fel@@ d obtained in France the Robert Es@@ n@@ ault @-@ Pel@@ teri@@ e prize and André Louis H@@ ir@@ sch for his &quot; In@@ tro@@ duc@@ ation to the re@@ mon@@ os@@ tics . &quot;
the doctor Jan G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski ( 18@@ 99 - 196@@ 6 ) , mentioned earlier , became a major lever of astron@@ om@@ y and the re@@ mon@@ au@@ tics .
he published hundreds of articles in po@@ ach magaz@@ ines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline .
G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski became a promot@@ er of the re@@ mon@@ os@@ tics , he was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was re@@ warded when his name was put to one of the hidden faces of the moon .
in 19@@ 25 , it was built in Poland in the year 19@@ 25 , which was going to be the source of a rocket engine .
unfortunately , it is unknown to who was the author of the proposal , nor are they known to the projects of the project .
it is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used for the gru@@ b of the cabin or for its slow@@ ed .
information on this file is limited to the collection in the press .
from the year 19@@ 33 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery started to work on the mis@@ siles .
the investigation was funded by K@@ om@@ or@@ ka Tech@@ ni@@ ki U@@ z@@ bro@@ j@@ ic in collaboration with the pro@@ f . Mi@@ ec@@ z@@ ys@@ justi@@ em Wol@@ f@@ k@@ em and pro@@ f .
from the conservative material , it is clear that research came to the test of practical evidence .
however , with the arrival of German troops , research was interrupted .
in the year 19@@ 37 , it appeared in the specialist press the pro@@ tot@@ y@@ pe of a photo@@ grap@@ e photo@@ grap@@ e of photo@@ graphy designed by the engine@@ er Ro@@ ho@@ zi@@ ń@@ ski and the next year was published by the &apos; R@@ ak@@ i@@ eta &quot; study , which is the case of the author L@@ eli@@ wa @-@ Kr@@ z@@ y@@ w@@ ob@@ loc@@ ki .
both projects were intended for the military use of engines for mis@@ siles .
shortly before the war , the provisional scientific advisory committee ( Ty@@ m@@ cz@@ as@@ ow@@ y K@@ om@@ it@@ et K@@ om@@ it@@ et @-@ N@@ au@@ k@@ ow@@ y @-@ N@@ au@@ k@@ ow@@ y ) was in charge of all the draft technology techniques for military use and coordinated all the work .
the committee was founded in 19@@ 37 , but after two years of activity , it was interrupted by the start of the war .
other studies dedicated to the bi@@ mon@@ au@@ tics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Pol@@ aca Society of astron@@ au@@ tics ( Pol@@ ski@@ e To@@ war@@ z@@ st@@ st@@ ak@@ ne ) .
in November 19@@ 54 of the Pro@@ bl@@ emy magazine , reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive items dedicated to astron@@ au@@ tics .
in one of them , the pro@@ f .
at that time , artificial satellite projects have already been launched and it was obvious that co@@ smi@@ c research was a discipline with prospects of future .
since the beginning of 1956 , the Pol@@ au@@ tics Society of astron@@ au@@ tics ( P@@ TA ) intended to form part of the International Federation of astron@@ au@@ tics ( founded in 19@@ 51 ) and in the autumn of that year the P@@ TA became a full member .
next year the first President of the P@@ TA , Kaz@@ imit@@ er@@ z Z@@ ar@@ an@@ ki@@ ew@@ ic@@ z ( 19@@ 02 - 19@@ 59 ) , went to the Vice @-@ President of the International Federation of astron@@ au@@ tics .
he played this office until his death in 19@@ 59 .
from 1956 , the P@@ TA participated significantly in the development of the R@@ M R@@ M ( R@@ ak@@ i@@ eta Met@@ e@@ or@@ olog@@ ic@@ z@@ na ) , which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out .
the first R@@ M @-@ 1 was completed in 19@@ 57 and was launched for the first time on 10 October 19@@ 58 .
the rocket had a nic@@ kel of 1 800 metres , 80 c@@ m of length and it didn &apos;t get to 5 kg of weight .
later , it is over to build the R@@ M @-@ 1@@ A version and in the summer of 19@@ 59 , the European R@@ M @-@ 2 aircraft tests were initiated in the desert of B@@ ł@@ ę@@ lia .
the co@@ he@@ te 1.@@ 4 metres and weigh@@ ed around 1@@ 1.5 .
another type of co@@ ke in development was to be the subject of real scientific study , the R@@ M @-@ 34 co@@ he@@ ir was going to have a 14@@ .5 kilome@@ tre and his mission would be to control the wind .
in 196@@ 2 , however , jobs were suspended .
the successor of the former R@@ M type of R@@ M was the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1 @-@ 1 , which was built during the 196@@ 2 and 19@@ 65 years .
it was designed as two stages , with a total length of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and an initial weight of 3@@ 2.@@ 5 kg .
three types ( so @-@ called Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ A were developed , 1@@ B and 1@@ C ) , which differenti@@ ate between the available space for scientific equipment .
in the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ A @-@ 1@@ A space available to the volume of 0.@@ 4 li@@ tres , in the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ B of 0.@@ 34 li@@ tres and in the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1@@ C of 0.@@ 62 li@@ tres .
the maximum winner in the three types was 37 km .
between the 19@@ 65 and 196@@ 8 years , it was developed in the Air Institute the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 2 @-@ 2 , whose first air test began in October 1970 .
the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 2 co@@ he@@ ir had an initial weight of 3@@ 80 kg and it was able to take a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 miles up .
then the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 2@@ h version was built and Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 3 .
it is also necessary to mention Poland &apos;s entry into the CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R ( Committee for Space Research ) in 19@@ 60 and the formation of the national Committee of CO@@ S@@ PA@@ R two years later .
in the context of the Inter@@ k@@ os@@ mos programme , Poland joined the research of the co@@ smi@@ c space on artificial Soviet satel@@ lites and , in 197@@ 8 , the Polish pilot Mi@@ ros@@ law Her@@ mas@@ z@@ ew@@ ski became the second inter@@ sop@@ it@@ au@@ t after V@@ lad@@ im@@ í@@ r Rem@@ ek .
the suspension of the law on social work is not the solution .
last week the constitutional court suspended the social law .
the resolution woke up a heated discussion in society .
of course , it will be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view .
the liberal economic systems in the EU , as in the globalised world , are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation .
consequently , this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict between themselves .
the cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital , together with un@@ brid@@ led financial speculation .
the effect of the major differences in labour costs ( salaries ) produces economic tensions .
under this concept , it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer , with the import of cheap goods , tries to shor@@ ten distances and to do so &apos; cause a lower price of the price of competi@@ tor with the aim of making the most of the market and , in this way , increasing its profit margin .
in a large scale it means , for the majority of employers , to transfer production to abroad , buy more cheap@@ ly or to disappear .
because private capital does not have a social responsibility , and it is therefore not responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon creates , increasing the social expenditure of the state .
this whole situation gives the total interest of employers to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profit .
the situation is universally known that there is no need to present specific statistical data .
the un@@ scrupulous practices of private capital create situations , in certain economies , where governments of such countries are forced to compete with the aim of artifici@@ ally reducing the social level of the population itself and , thus , attr@@ acting foreign capital to the country .
in other words , governments put private capital available to their own population without taking account of social decline .
this is evident above all in the changes in existing laws .
the aim is to force the population to accept the dict@@ ate of private capital , especially as regards wages .
this takes place , on the one hand , through the system of economic obligation in the long @-@ term unemployment case ; on the other hand , through the restricted right of employees on labour rights .
the result is growing poverty alongside the increase in the gap between poor and rich .
for a number of years , there are in Germany points of food delivery for poor people who cannot be kept with their own work .
the number of people who receive this type of aid is already coming to a million .
in the context of the increased competitiveness of the German economy , a very frequent case is produced : people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay for the minimum to the minimum to survive .
a scandal was made of this kind of connection with the situation of the German Labour Parliament .
the savings measures of practically all the countries of the south of the EU lead to the same situation , and the people , pressed by an ab@@ is@@ mal decline of their social level , are forced to emigr@@ ate as in the 19@@ th century or to live with a fatal wage in the area of the private society , with the hope that one day to the private private capital country .
is it necessary to ask where it comes from ?
in the case of other EU countries , then poverty comes from a country to another or never comes , since Chinese , Indians , Braz@@ ilian , Turkish , Moroccan , Egyptian , Moroccan , Egyptian and Afr@@ icans continue to work for an in@@ secure European wage .
this also affects Latin America .
the liberal the@@ ories and the media claim to the mercy that the state should not bring capital to the economy , leading the economy leads to its failure .
private capital def@@ ends with n@@ ails and teeth that the state should not intervene in the med@@ dling economy .
then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its ego@@ ism in the political process and , therefore , throughout the state .
in this case the answer is clearly affirm@@ ative .
the proof is the existence of lobbies , in practice very powerful and om@@ ni@@ present , in all states .
the result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption , in the mutual fav@@ ors , in a legislation that is almost unlikely everywhere but not punish@@ able .
in Germany the situation is the following : State minis@@ tries , lack of financial resources , the wording of law projects to private legal undertakings , which are often linked to industry .
this kind of draft law is approved in the B@@ und@@ est@@ ag , the German parliament .
in this way , the whole power does not come from the people , as is announced in the constitutions of Western democracies , but of the strong financial groups representing their own interests .
it is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly found in a situation where it describes Ap@@ pi@@ á@@ us in its work of the Roman re@@ public crisis in Ca@@ esar and Pom@@ pe@@ ya : &quot; the state was in the process of dis@@ integrating and the administrations concerned . &quot;
in exchange for bri@@ bes , fav@@ ors obtained legitimately and helps to fund stones or sp@@ ades .
bri@@ bery and corruption were extended without any impedi@@ ment and people were coming to the ballot ballot with the ap@@ praise in advance , &quot; there were no people with a view to the fact that the only option for such a serious situation was that the only remedy for such a serious situation was the autocr@@ acy and that it was the only one that was to be held in the administration of the world , and it would have been the case for a strong man to be able to say that the only remedy for such
the conclusion , in the same way as in the anti@@ qu@@ age , is that today &apos;s society is based on dis@@ considered preferences of individual profit without taking account of common interests .
private capital is not capable of understanding and calling for the benefits of the whole society .
the result is the same as then , a dec@@ ad@@ ence of the unprecedented elite , without an effort to reform it in depth .
the causes of the rise in fasci@@ st and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the un@@ brid@@ led liberalisation of economic systems in the 19@@ th and 20th century .
with respect to the current situation , it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in the interests of a liberal democracy , such as a clear break , waiting for the next coup .
the fact is that the current elite is completely unaware of the losses of hundreds of thousands in life , social disasters and humanitarian and humanitarian disasters that we have witnessed , as well as the crimes against humanity , as we know in ancient and most recent history .
the suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution ; at least not in the long term .
under pressure from economic competition , both internationally and within the EU , the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to pursue other ways to reduce the social level of the population .
this trend is therefore systemic .
the solution goes through concrete socio @-@ political reforms , which strengthen both the participation of the state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and to weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state .
Israel : the lab of chaos .
&quot; that is the case that you eat , and you know , that there can be no mention of violence and nothing could do it , St@@ ing in your Fr@@ ag@@ ile song and whose str@@ ink@@ le , &quot; let us not forget how fragile we are .
&quot; if my children don &apos;t want wars , there would be no &quot; Gu@@ TV &quot; , the wife of Mayer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth@@ s@@ child , in his death bed in the year 18@@ 49 .
after the latest experience of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip , they have emerged , as always , mixed reactions .
one , on the side of Israel , argu@@ es in favour of the right of self @-@ defence and the Palestinians in the role of terrorists .
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the massacres that are regularly repeated and who is the victim , and after all , the citizens of today in Israel , including the autonomous territories , were born within the current political and not living in the current political situation .
my intention is to offer the read@@ ers a look behind the cur@@ tain , a look to find out who is taking advantage of the tensions that have been dragged out for 95 years from the Bal@@ four declaration in a small area of the Middle East .
some of my considerations are based on historical facts , others in conclusions which I have reached on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter , on who or which group of people is the main thrust of the events of modern history .
in the history of mankind the history of the strugg@@ les is in the front row .
at every time we can find an Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ro Mag@@ non or an Napole@@ on .
but what is no longer so clear is whether they were always these charac@@ ters who were acting independently or whether behind their thr@@ one there was someone who guided their actions towards a certain objective .
we must accept that we live in a time that concentr@@ ates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this means , has not been able to arrive at one generation .
among these astron@@ om@@ ically rich families highlights one that could be seen as the most prominent one ( if there is still someone behind , I do not know , but I do not want to say it :
it does not write much to them .
of course .
in the nin@@ et@@ een@@ th years of the 19@@ th century purch@@ ased the first news agency ( Re@@ u@@ ters ) so that they were to be associated with their name with criminal acts of very seriousness .
they have important particip@@ ations in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented , it has been declared or is preparing a war : before the attack on Afghanistan was 7 , after the attack on the Russian Government , it was five , after the attack on Iraq .
anyone who tried to oppose this family has died .
A@@ bra@@ ham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank of the Central Bank of America of the Roth@@ s@@ child , started during the Sec@@ ession War for money and was killed in 18@@ 65 in the theatre .
J@@ F@@ K began to im@@ pri@@ se money and I wanted to suspend the federal reserve system ( EDF ) and was murdered in 196@@ 3 ; the congres@@ sman Louis M@@ c F@@ ad@@ den was pois@@ oned by the year 19@@ 36 after he wanted to sue the major economic crisis in 19@@ 29 .
his quest for world power took them over the 18@@ 59 years - 18@@ 71 to bring a plan with three world wars , designed by the Albert Pi@@ ke , con@@ decor@@ ated with the degree 33 .
the first war was marked as an objective to eliminate the large mon@@ arch@@ ic states throughout Europe ; the second wanted to remove the colonial supre@@ m@@ acy , especially from Britain , and the third one proposed to reduce the population of the land between half a million and a half million people , as well as the creation of a universal religion ( the equ@@ ation ) and the final establishment of the powers of absolute life .
the method with which the group of the richest families is operating , together with the Roth@@ s@@ child , is still the dynam@@ ics of the trigger of crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution ( ab@@ ab ) .
these solutions are , however , wrong , and they always have a worsening of the situation , if not , it is enough to remember that the EDF was set up in order not to repeat a crisis like that of the year 19@@ 07 .
so , after the success of the murder of the he@@ ir to the Austr@@ or @-@ Hungarian thr@@ one , Francisco Fern@@ ando , in Sarajevo and after , after that , the First World War was triggered , they destroyed Russia with the beginning of the revolution .
the First World War is suddenly over and unjustified from the military and economic point of view , the capit@@ ul@@ ation of Germany ( wars for the end of the Russian Russia were already unnecessary ) and the post of the great power of Central Europe , the Austr@@ o @-@ H@@ Hungarian empire .
in order to prepare the ground of the Second World War , they allowed the ban@@ kers and politicians to believe , in an indiscrimin@@ ate way , a situation of conflict in the wake of the enormous war repa@@ irs imposed on Germany , which was created by a number of nation@@ alities , which had been made to the end of the world &apos;s fifth , and it was very good , and that it was very well @-@ founded , and that it was very good , and it was just as well , to build the
at the end of the nin@@ et@@ een@@ th century , the Roth@@ s@@ child pushed the foundation of the ruling movement , a branch that aspi@@ res to the formation of a Jewish state , preferably in the region of the former Ju@@ dea with Jerusalem ( return to S@@ RO ) .
the Bal@@ four declaration previously mentioned the basis for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place .
terrorist attacks were produced in both sides .
the Second World War : it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope that international ban@@ kers had in a principle or whether everything he did was part of a plan , but the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the op@@ tim@@ al conditions for the status of the Jewish state .
Israel was officially founded in 19@@ 48 and , similarly in the way the war repa@@ irs imposed on Germany pa@@ ved the way to the Second World War , with the proclam@@ ation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war .
if international ban@@ kers managed to initiate it , the Jewish nation , like in the Second World War , would become the victim in the first line of combat , now with the Arab population or , generally , Muslim in the Middle East .
Israel is an immense lab , a bac@@ hel@@ or machine and chaos , not only in the context of its country , but also at international level , let us take as an example how to divide the sympath@@ ies and opponents of Israel .
who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian conflict ?
on this point , it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their comman@@ ders because , as is the case in our country , international ban@@ kers only present their candidates in the elections .
the current president of Israel B. Net@@ any@@ ahu is the typical example of fasci@@ st politician , loyal to international ban@@ kers , which makes every possible effort to declare the war on Iran and , in view of the fact that Iran is a member of the world of the world , it would lead to the destruction of the world economy .
under what light is the words that David Roc@@ k@@ ef@@ el@@ ler said in 1994 : &quot; the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order . &quot;
the new world order in its imagination is a world of gentlemen and sl@@ aves .
a world where the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well @-@ balanced financial ari@@ st@@ ocr@@ acy .
a world where every new individual is being introduced to a chip that controls all its being .
&quot; and it oblig@@ es everyone , small and large , rich and poor , free and sl@@ aves , to have a mark on the right hand or in the front , not unless they take the name of this monster or the numbers of their name .
it is necessary to understand : who has two fingers in front of me , that I give the numbers of this monster .
the number to the person and this number is se@@ is@@ hundred 60 and six .
film Ar@@ go : if it gets crude , call Hollywood
in November 1979 a group of Islam@@ ist students involved the American emb@@ assy in Te@@ h@@ ran and took 52 diplom@@ ons as hostages .
his release was going to be in return for the sha@@ h @-@ sha@@ h R@@ é@@ za R@@ é@@ za R@@ á@@ h@@ vi , which after the run @-@ up to the United States , the country that had spon@@ sor@@ ed its regime for decades .
for the American administration the situation would not offer any positive prospects : to throw the sha@@ h out of it , I could not allow it , as , if it did , it would jeopardise the confidence of its allies in other countries .
but the release of the hostages in Iran , where the revolution had led to the constitution of the the@@ ocr@@ atic regime , was not in its scope .
it was a blow to the presti@@ ge of the United States , which subsequently stepped up further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force .
the imprisoned diplomats were released 4@@ 44 days after the government &apos;s negotiating intervention .
in the US , its fate caused a wave of solidarity and encouragement against Iran .
the failure in Iran made a decisive contribution to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential elections in 1980 .
the &quot; Ar@@ go &quot; film of the director and an actor Ben Af@@ f@@ lec@@ k fear a episode of this story , which took a little success for America .
little before taking the emb@@ assy , six employees from building were escaped .
after a complicated expertise , they ended up in the Canadian emb@@ assy .
CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , managed to get them out of Iran , for this helped a cover @-@ up story : they came out with Canadian passports , as members of the film team that looked at the location in the country for a po@@ oling of science fic@@ tion .
combination of g@@ ents
the plan drawn up by the expert in &quot; ex@@ le@@ ation &quot; T@@ oni Men@@ dez wanted the cooperation of Hollywood .
in order for the lie to appear to be tru@@ thful , it was written on the film project in speci@@ alized magaz@@ ines , and press conferences were organised , the fic@@ tional production company had even a real office .
the details on the operation were kept secret for a long time , the film has been made from the memories of Tony Men@@ dez .
the Mul@@ f@@ lec@@ k film is a unique combination of several g@@ ags .
on the one hand , a realistic political thri@@ ller ; on the other , a call for a &quot; go@@ er &quot; , the history of a episode that went well , a decep@@ tion ( one example can be the Ocean &apos; E@@ lev@@ en ) .
in the film , the Member States are combined with a well @-@ documented sequ@@ ence of Te@@ h@@ ran in the sequ@@ ence of the era of events , which were reflected in the same way in the film ; there are not many differences in this .
on the other hand , there are typical parts of Hollywood a more li@@ vi@@ le , marked by ir@@ ony and an exagger@@ ation .
furthermore , scenes of the CIA plant and other institutions : men brought to the negotiating table , in the corridors of the office , on the phone ...
Ben Af@@ f@@ lec@@ k has succeeded in re@@ opening his career in an excellent way .
the actor , which had been the subject of bur@@ sters , has become a respec@@ table director and its way of acting has ce@@ ased to be the target of ir@@ onic remarks .
FYROM is its third time , after &quot; small @-@ bye , far@@ e@@ well &apos; ( 2007 ) and the k@@ own .
at the same time , it is the first fan of Af@@ f@@ lec@@ k in which action does not take place in the city of Boston , where it was raised .
in addition , the sensitivity of the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that would put the films of old films above Hollywood standards .
and Af@@ f@@ lec@@ k shows it in Ar@@ go , where Te@@ h@@ ran is &quot; wheel &quot; in Canada .
the best scenes of the film have taken place in the streets , in the reconstruction of the my@@ dic@@ al events , the introductory sequ@@ ence of the emb@@ assy is impressive for its senti@@ ment that , at the same time , trans@@ mit the exci@@ tement of the dis@@ cord and the lack of pre@@ dict@@ ation arising when , at some rate , history gives a step forward .
Sal@@ f@@ lec@@ k and his collabor@@ ators get a similar effect on the fic@@ tion scenes ( the im@@ post@@ or team in the mud of Te@@ h@@ ran ) .
too much action in too many places
the director had to accept the fact that a story explained does not offer much in the cinema sense of the most intri@@ gu@@ ing scenes .
and it is quite right , sometimes it adds something to the reality : it does not come out so eleg@@ ant ( the scene in which the crisis is in Te@@ h@@ ran airport , the devi@@ ation of a call to America and the un@@ brid@@ led search after its lead .
Ar@@ go &apos;s flu@@ id is the dis@@ control of the need to show too much action in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Good@@ man have a very funny role to play in Hollywood , although his charac@@ ters deserve more space and are not , much less , the only ones in this fil@@ me .
for these reasons , the Mul@@ f@@ lec@@ k film loses a little dramatic , but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest , to assess its implementation and the re@@ tro of a thri@@ ller that ev@@ alls the 197@@ 0s .
but that will collapse , that will be difficult .
as you ev@@ apor@@ ate a real story and as proof of the over@@ shad@@ owed nature that may be the om@@ ni@@ ial and om@@ it@@ ences of the secret services , it is enough .
rules for the inf@@ ancy , bananas and circus
the ser@@ ver w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ P. ov@@ ov@@ ni@@ po@@ silver , which every year presents a survey on the most absurd bank charges , has now decided to announce the contest on the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU &apos;s work@@ shop .
&quot; we came up after the last event , the EU has plans to adopt a 40 % share of women in the main European companies &apos; , explained P@@ acu@@ vo Patri@@ k N@@ acher , the organis@@ er of the survey .
among the absurd nomin@@ ates , for example , the recent decision of the European Court of Com@@ mer@@ ing insurance between men and women .
so far , women were getting better prices in life insurance because they represent a lower risk .
&quot; other incredible ideas of the EU &apos;s work@@ shop can be proposals by the end of this year &apos; .
the choice will take place at the end of February 2013 , reported N@@ ason .
the EU &apos;s controversial regulations are , for example , the compulsory addition of bio@@ components to fuel which , as a result , damages the environment ; another ban is the use of the ther@@ mom@@ ics of mercury across the whole of life because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the Som@@ h@@ ine direc@@ tory .
there has been criticism of the f@@ ac@@ tic ban on the use of &quot; butter &quot; or the withdrawal of the classic bul@@ b of the pigs .
quality bananas must have a six @-@ inch length of 14 @-@ inch .
the Union &apos;s appar@@ atus takes this kind of decision often under pressure from one or another commercial lobby , whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states ( the Czech Republic , even with the threat of the veto ) .
the interests of an lobby were behind the request , for example , that higher quality bananas should have in the EU a length of at least 14 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters and they could not be able to present &apos; English cur@@ ses &apos; .
the European Commission was defended by saying that this only seeks to harmonise the non @-@ homo@@ genous national standards to date , which only complic@@ ate its marketing .
the rules which refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU , despite the opposition of some states , have been watered down on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of comfort .
the candidate to win the survey could be the prescription of the EU &apos;s last year according to which in the inf@@ ants that are mark@@ eted is compulsory warning that children under 8 @-@ year @-@ old are not allowed to inf@@ ant without an adult .
the EU made reference here to an American study according to which , when it comes to toys , the bal@@ lo@@ ons are the main cause of child death for suf@@ foc@@ ation .
similarly , a similar restriction applies to the use of pil@@ gri@@ ms by children to 14 years .
funny events are even born in our country .
equally absurd is the regulation relating to European officials : everyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia .
the ser@@ ver B@@ ank@@ ov@@ nic@@ po@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ d , in collaboration with the secular economic partnership partnership , was nomin@@ ated in the survey , among some absurd proposals above , the prescription of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State .
the EU determined the maximum amounts of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic the same day of our entry into the EU .
then the Czech Republic over@@ went , for example , the volume set for se@@ als in conserv@@ ing , which was a threat of substantial fine .
the organiz@@ ers of the survey were also interested in paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting subsidies for subsidies .
this kind of ideas didn &apos;t happen in Brussels but in Prague .
&quot; we are at the disadvantage of not having sea .
we call on the European Union to compensation , stated in the autumn of 2004 , the Minister of agriculture Jar@@ os@@ lav Pal@@ as ( D@@ SD ) .
he argued with the fact that in our country there was a lot of cereal and , as a result of the call shopping , the state had the war@@ ehouse full and had to be exported .
according to Pal@@ as , since the Czech Republic is far from sea ports , the EU should pay for hundreds of millions of euros .
at the end of the day , the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organised a public contest for the purchase of the cereal countries that have no access to the sea .
the subsidy to receive a subsidy was proposed to the municip@@ alities for local development by the Minister P@@ av@@ el N@@ asi .
EU : the rare prescri@@ ptions are an exception
the guidelines of the Member States are often white of criticism , the EU &apos;s efforts in terms of regulations and , furthermore , a more effective and more effective functioning and development throughout the Union .
according to experts , the most serious problem is , for example , EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration , but that the Member States have managed in the negotiations on budgets .
the Cz@@ ech@@ s also play the sensitive fi@@ bre , in the same way as other countries in the Union , the fight for the right to origin of their traditional products , although our country has not always been vic@@ tori@@ ous from these pu@@ gn@@ es .
the Cz@@ ech@@ s , after six years of the German and Austrian disputes , were successfully defended by the name of the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c Act of Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c , but they had to change the name to the national rum , whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19@@ th century .
only the products produced from the sugar bas@@ ket can be called rum , but not those of sugar be@@ et .
on the official list of protected desig@@ nations of the EU , together with the ugly and high @-@ known le@@ ague in the world , the G@@ ü@@ bec@@ k city of German L@@ ü@@ bec@@ k , or the ham of Par@@ ma , are already in the case of Kar@@ lov@@ y V@@ ary cook@@ ies , and , even , the variety of l@@ aps , the Po@@ ho@@ ł@@ eli@@ ce , and , even , the variety of can@@ s .
as protected by the EU , you can be proud of the Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice bread and the Ho@@ kes@@ ice Bay Po@@ d@@ k@@ r@@ k@@ on@@ é .
people want me to save the re@@ public , but I &apos;m an amat@@ eur .
Mr Senator , how did you come to the elections for President ?
it is not a sen@@ ator or president .
if in our country it was all right , then I would not present my candid@@ acy .
but I can no longer stand to see how the last twenty years in our country , how thi@@ eves are un@@ punished , are increasing taxes and retirement age .
I had no ambition to be political .
when I see something I do not like , I try to give a solution to change it .
and since I have 40 years old and my candid@@ acy is independent , the only possibility I have to change is to present myself as Senator or president .
the Senate has already arrived , but shortly after the presidency has gone .
is he not giving the back to those who voted for it ?
I always said that my candid@@ acy to the presidency was dependent on the results of the sen@@ ator .
later I know that if I was elected Senator , I would introduce my candid@@ acy to the presidency .
but my objective is not the function ; the function is the tool that I can make my own ideas .
that is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate .
the problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticise in the bar or in front of television , but we are tram@@ pled on anyone who wants to start a change .
this is the means of communication , which will dis@@ appoint you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom of lying .
it says that I have bri@@ bed journalists or I have been accused of Ji@@ ř@@ í Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
let &apos;s talk about your ideas .
it is presented to the presidential struggle with a financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over 20 million .
it must change the law .
as president does not have this competence and only the sen@@ ator as a whole can propose laws .
how do you want to resolve it ?
as a citizen , I have been part of a lobby for the guide to be recognised as self @-@ employed work , and we got it .
the problem is in politics : if someone comes with a good proposal , whether it is right or left , it is rejected on purpose and this affects the citizens .
as an independent candidate , I have a greater potential for the support of all parliamentary groups .
I have the ability to choose something that is best for our country and apply it .
is a man of right or left @-@ wing ?
from the Czech point of view , I have the impression that people consider me more left .
it is not important for me , either a little left or a little right .
what I care about is that we go ahead .
I don &apos;t care if someone is right or left , I want to join people .
I always openly support any good solution , irrespective of whether the proposal comes from the K@@ S@@ addy or the O@@ DS and , similarly , I will be against the bad ideas .
it makes a joke when you say that it is popu@@ list .
but is he not demonstrating what he says ?
when a business plan is created for business , you also have certain objectives and ideals .
and you try to get closer to them .
there will be those who call it popu@@ lism , but all the proposals I am talking about already work in the world or known experts .
but without the support of Parliament alone , you are still attached .
and it cannot survive in the long @-@ term policy .
or do you think that if you are headed to people and talk to them , you will , for example , have a criminal and financial responsibility ?
I have no choice .
convince politicians , journalists and civil society and try to put them on my part to achieve it .
if it were elected president , there would be no problem in organising a direct broadcast for television in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legiti@@ mise criminal and financial responsibility for politicians , officials , judges and prosecu@@ tors of the state .
and , eventually , they would have to communicate why they don &apos;t want it .
if there is a strong character indicating disputes , pressure can be made on the political scene .
let us take the direct choice of the president , which has been an achievement of public pressure .
at the same time I say that I &apos;m just a fan , I am not a genius or an intellectual .
for my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies .
I just started in politics and I try to get the greatest possible support for my programme .
I try to get things out of myself , but in the event that it does not go well , in six years &apos; time I will leave it and I will return to the private sector .
it sounds a little like O@@ k@@ am@@ ura to save the Czech Republic .
I &apos;m no saving .
I know that with a person I do nothing , that is why I have visited a number of familiar person@@ alities , in case they were encouraged to present their candid@@ acy to the sen@@ ator .
I went to see Rad@@ im Jan@@ č@@ ura , but he refused because he had a lot of work .
for my part , I have at least supported the J@@ ana Lor@@ en@@ co@@ v@@ á investig@@ ative journalist , which brought in the light of fraud with light heating o@@ ils .
I put on the basis that people are really unhappy , now I am in the balance .
sixty percent of the population did not come to the polls and , those who did , voted to the representatives of the establishment .
we are two of the independent sector .
people chose the sen@@ ator , so it will be difficult to achieve changes .
however , I will defend my own ideas , such as the direct choice of may@@ ors or rul@@ ers .
are you considering forming your own party ?
I haven &apos;t seen it yet because I have no time for this , to check out the un@@ bear@@ able past of each of the potential members of the party , nor do I have any money .
I do not have money or for the campaign to the presidency , in my own transparent , only 20,000 cor@@ ons .
do you have no money ?
he talks about property statements , how is yours ?
I believe my private property in some 60 million .
in Prague , I have an estimated place in 25 million , an estimated 10 million floor , another floor in eight million , a collection of works of art with a value of ten million , an A@@ ston Martin of 3@@ .5 million and a Š@@ ko@@ da Super@@ b valued in a million .
by the way , I have an A@@ ston Martin because it was my youth dream , and I always liked James B@@ ond , who was driving this car , it was a gall@@ ant with women and , at the same time , fought against mal@@ ties and in@@ jus@@ tices .
do you conduct an A@@ ston Martin , your property is valued in 60 million and has no money for the campaign ?
you say you want to change the public , but you don &apos;t want to put too much money on your part .
it is not very convincing .
I have no 15 million for the campaign .
do I have to debt ?
in the campaign I have already put 2.5 million .
the fact that he has no spon@@ sor shows that there is not too much interest in my programme .
and I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket .
the costs of the campaign cover in essence what I will receive at Senator &apos;s salary .
but I couldn &apos;t live from it , for example , I couldn &apos;t pay my son the English school , which is a hundred 000 monthly cor@@ ons .
if I want to win money , then I would not present as a candidate .
so will it continue with business activity in order to live ?
did he not say before he was going to leave this activity ?
this has nothing to do with a higher salary .
as I promised , I have partly left my activities .
for example , the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring .
people would want me to be the s@@ amar@@ itan that saved the re@@ public .
but I also need to live in something .
how much ac@@ custom@@ ed to earn men@@ su@@ ally as an entrepreneur ?
between 200@@ ,000 and 4@@ 00,000 , I still win .
if I were president , then I would leave business .
you can consult all the interview on Saturday &apos;s edi@@ tion .
the architecture of the M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architecture shows that the real advent@@ ures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ se library and the newly concluded mountain of books - 2 photos .
&quot; I think that the building is fun , it has a stubborn aspect , and there is finally something interesting to see &apos; , &quot; says Li@@ set@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ ig , a trans@@ mer@@ te that goes through the street .
and Stef@@ an S@@ per@@ mon , T@@ I &apos;s technical tech@@ nici@@ ans in a large company near the library , points : &quot; besides , the building is pretty . &quot;
but I wonder why we need a library today .
we all have the Internet , tab@@ lets and electronic books .
no one is happy in these last @-@ fashioned libraries , right ?
Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ is@@ se , a living city located at the R@@ ó@@ zie gates that hardly deserves a smo@@ ker , holds the dubious honour of having a record to forget .
the population of 8@@ 0,000 inhabitants presents the lower al@@ literacy rate in the Netherlands .
in order to counter this shameful situation , some years ago , it was decided to contribute to the general culture and to copy the seven bridges that are represented in the euro notes in the form of the mini @-@ al@@ ters in the form of dec@@ eived ar@@ mies .
the success of the educational offensive was limited .
and that was how politicians decided that there was only one chance to improve statistics : a library should be built !
Win@@ y Ma@@ as , the Dutch T@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V architecture study , all a teacher in the art of the bar@@ k and responsible buildings for a variety of fun buildings , took place with his usual calm@@ ness and shared the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books in the face and a smile in the face .
and while the jury was looking at her around and took his shoulders , Ma@@ as acted to ap@@ p the books by forming a py@@ rami@@ d and concluded his brief speech with the following words : &quot;
here , my proposal for the mountain of Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ se books , the so @-@ called &apos; Bo@@ e@@ k@@ enberg &apos; .
nine years later , the EUR 30 million mountain is closed at the planned place .
this is part of the draft revit@@ alisation , which is complete with a sub@@ way parking gap , a super@@ market , a post office and a couple of housing buildings .
at the beginning of November the mountain of books was gal@@ ar@@ don@@ ated with the second prize &quot; B@@ est Li@@ br@@ ary &quot; of 2012 .
moreover , the project is also nomin@@ ated to the Dutch National W@@ ood A@@ ward A@@ ward .
in this way , the small city of history , which until the date had nothing but to offer a post @-@ modern area and an incredibly ugly city after the white fac@@ ade one would have a more than a two @-@ way , is now with contemporary architecture .
but above all , Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ se is now available from the first public cultural building in its history .
the long way to the book
the first impression is that this is a book paradi@@ se under a qu@@ es@@ era .
well , it is true that there is an elev@@ ator that is transported to us just at the heart of this mountain m@@ aci@@ ty , but the real am@@ atives of space and reading do not use it , but prefer to be with their to@@ po@@ graphy to the top .
the inside of the world is completely lu@@ min@@ ous and easy to cover with sight , the ground of bric@@ ks collected and the eleg@@ ant eleg@@ ants support the public condition of the library .
the urban environment is perfect .
in the face of the face , the banks of the park can be found , dogs and children and girls playing football .
and for all sides books , books and more books .
&quot; normally the books are prepared throughout the fac@@ ade and at the centre is open to an enormous dark room , which , generally , is usually somewhat awkward and im@@ personal , &quot; says Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
what we have done is to kick up the classic sp@@ aces of space and to get the home zone out of the outside .
the inside of the mountain is very well exploited : the Internet , the Internet library , the ch@@ ess club , the centre of environmental education and the maintenance room .
special mention must be taken of the black shel@@ ves taking the role of m@@ ural re@@ dressed , and at the same time .
look , the t@@ act and the smell are strang@@ ers .
even the architec@@ ts and the civil engine@@ ers more to the day take the head when they hear about this unknown material .
&quot; we wanted to work with recycl@@ ed materials , &quot; explains Jo@@ op T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st , Chief of the project in the city of Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ se .
and that is how it is a day , in a Spanish farming exploitation , we are faced with the right sub@@ product from agriculture .
for many years , in the gre@@ et@@ houses and in the fields of the Netherlands , a plastic tissue of small me@@ tals is used as a basis for holding the roots of crops .
this is cheap and efficient material .
this fin@@ al fabric two stations and then dis@@ appears .
for the library this fabric was pr@@ ayed , for the first time in such quantities , to make four c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters available .
with the heat and pressure , the so @-@ called agricultural plastic ( K@@ LO ) changes colour and becomes a dark material , homo@@ gene@@ ous and resist@@ ant material that smells like a new car mix and a shoe of sport .
after 105 pe@@ damages gets to the top of the mountain .
at the end of this continuous route of nearly 500 metres around the mountain we await the reward : from the cafe@@ teria , it is not only a fantastic view of the city , but it can also be enjoyed by the Dutch , but also , in that way , some of the Dutch people and their anc@@ estors .
these create a nice environment to the way that the proper air hu@@ me@@ ty is maintained for this liter@@ ature mountain .
donations for a new soul
&quot; even if I believe it , given its large @-@ scale areas , this building is an exemplary project as regards ec@@ ology , T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st .
the heating and the necessary refriger@@ ation are obtained from geo@@ mal energy .
despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge glass py@@ rami@@ d , even in the most sun@@ ny days the sun only clo@@ ses out for a few hours .
the huge wood stocks placed in trans@@ ver@@ sal sense to the glass fac@@ ade serve to give shadow and absorb most of the sun &apos;s ra@@ ys .
this creates a comfortable internal climate .
the rest is the automatic persist@@ s .
Stef@@ an S@@ per@@ mon , the scep@@ tic worker in the Information System , has already dar@@ ed to put foot in the new library .
and Li@@ set@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also been there .
similarly , the traditional Chinese medical teacher Cy@@ n@@ thia Bo@@ gar@@ de has visited the library .
the reason is that , for the opening of a couple of weeks ago , all the inhabitants of the city were invited to don@@ ate a book of their private collection .
in this way , it is intended to fill the le@@ aks of a library that still does not have its full file ; at present , it has 7@@ 0,000 exemplary sums .
the concept has cal@@ bed deep .
the shel@@ ves are re@@ plac@@ eable .
&quot; there is nothing worse than an empty library , &quot; says the Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
&quot; I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building .
everyone knows that his book is part of the library .
even if I &apos;m just there to wor@@ ship .
in this way , the M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ V study has achieved a success in that queen that in the speci@@ alized ar@@ k is known as &quot; creating an identity . &quot;
the city of Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ se has written a piece of liter@@ ature story .
regardless of the young and in@@ cul@@ ted thing that can be .
finally , a starting point for shaping its identity .
Sz@@ ab@@ o : &quot; the Germans must play a more prominent role . &quot;
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine .
according to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , an expert in American relations , U@@ U@@ .@@ Europe , Europe , this puts Berlin in a fairly risky diplomatic position .
Deut@@ sche W@@ elle : at the beginning of the week Germany gave it to understand that I would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of the United Nations observer status .
finally , Berlin abstained .
why ?
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o : Germany does not support what Israelis have done in Gaza .
well , because of the special relationship linking the country with Israel , Germany must be careful .
but at the same time I think it does not support the American position either .
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel .
during the lifting that took place in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also abstained when it was about establishing a flight ban .
this has finally been declared by NATO .
is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are at stake ?
Yeah , that &apos;s right .
this is because it is now re@@ direc@@ ting its foreign policy , moving away from a policy leading , so to speak , by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy .
and what makes things even harder is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy .
the Germans are therefore in a cross@@ roads .
they are expected to play a more independent role , but they are not used to it .
I think they are still looking at what their role will be , but they have already started the way to a normal foreign policy .
a similar foreign policy to the countries like France or Great Britain .
what does a normal foreign policy mean from the German point of view ?
it is a policy which , when it comes to national interests , is determined to defend different positions in the United States or its European partners .
I believe that German foreign policy is a strong motivation in economic policy , in other words exports and their relations with certain regions , such as Russia , China or the Middle East .
the German economic interests are to a certain extent different from other major powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests .
are these economic interests influenced in the position of the Middle East conflict and the UN vote ?
on the one hand , Germany has large markets in the Middle East , especially in the Gulf .
this is why it must be careful and not to be an alien one of Arab public opinion or the Arab eli@@ tes .
this is important , of course .
but I would not give you such importance as it is not a completely unilateral relationship .
however , they play a key role in German considerations .
has Germany undermined its relationship with America , U@@ DA to abstain from voting in important decisions as in the vote on Palestine ?
I think in Europe , and even in the United States , the German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding .
for this reason , I do not believe that there has been such a drastic break as in the case of Libya .
perhaps Germany has achieved a certain amount of respect .
after all , all of this has not done but to show that it is a country that takes seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account .
there are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative .
on the other hand , America was clearly in favour of a veto .
is there a dispar@@ ity of views between America , U@@ DA and many European nations ?
these disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy .
I believe that the Obama government is in secret of a great understanding towards the European position .
but because of the political situation here , it is clear that the government cannot defend that position in public .
I believe that the real dispar@@ ity of opinions does not actually have the size of it .
if we look at the relations between Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister Net@@ any@@ ahu , we see Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy that develops .
is it difficult for Germany to reconcile the close relations with Israel and the United States , on the one hand , with the position of its main partners in the EU , on the other ?
I think that is precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans .
of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homo@@ genous European policy , but it is not the case .
therefore , they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher one , but they must boost things from their own position .
that is precisely what they are doing now with the euro .
I believe that in future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position .
of course , this is not easy for Germany , either by the relationship with Israel .
this has always been a dangerous issue .
but I think the Germans are clear that they must play an independent role .
does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor ?
or is it perhaps still difficult to accept that leadership ?
Germany has not yet been used , it is always somewhat awkward and , for obvious reasons , the country continues to play a more important role .
if we look at the euro crisis , for example , we see that every time Germany takes a leading role as a main actor , certain anti @-@ German feelings are dis@@ continued .
this is not easy for the Germans .
it is an old problem and that nobody wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries .
in this way , Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States .
it must show a recep@@ tive attitude to the different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy .
the US &apos;s influence on the European policy is increasingly declining , but the EU does not cover that gap at the moment , who is there then ?
the Germans will not be allowed to take a more leading role .
even if they do not like it , if it is unpleasant or if it makes them even more popular , c &apos;@@ est the vie !

&quot; protection of mark@@ ings &quot; in China : when Pu@@ ma and Ar@@ man@@ i become Chinese marks
Ar@@ man@@ i is a world @-@ wide mark and Polo Ralph Lauren .
but what is Ar@@ man@@ i Polo ?
after this name there is an officially registered name in China , but it has nothing to do with the original companies .
however , this has protection while the real ep@@ op@@ es are not present .
and even then it is not clear that they are going to be given the reason .
&quot; to foreigners is becoming more and more difficult to protect their marks in China , &quot; it says Thomas P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch , lawyer of the bu@@ fe@@ te Taylor W@@ essing speci@@ alized in violation of protection rights in the Middle East .
every week comes to my table a new case .
the imit@@ ators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks .
in this way , Guc@@ ci becomes L@@ u @-@ Guc@@ ci and instead of Pr@@ ada @-@ K@@ ny .
German companies are also legally cop@@ ied in the same way , as has happened to the car manufacturer of Pu@@ ma goods .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch opens up an archi@@ v@@ er in which he has the heads of the Beijing Mar@@ marks office .
on 14 September 2010 a Chinese company called for the Z@@ eg@@ na DF to register Z@@ eg@@ na DF Pu@@ ma , an artificial name that was also served by the Er@@ men@@ egi@@ l@@ do Z@@ eg@@ na .
the Chinese are world champi@@ ons in that of cop@@ ying and violating intellectual property rights is well known .
in the big cities there are large deposi@@ ts of various plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeiting .
however , the cases of P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch are from another nature , for the sake of their clients , he fought against the fact that the book@@ mark office is officially granted the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere .
the Chinese call it &quot; B@@ ang M@@ ing P@@ ai &quot; or mark up .
the word has its origin in the Chinese &apos; B@@ ang D@@ ak@@ u@@ an &apos; .
it makes reference to women who have &quot; fish &quot; to a rich man .
the Chinese authorities do not feel guilty .
&quot; it is harmful to business , we need to fight it , &quot; it requires P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
&quot; the mark makes water , the monopoli@@ stic position dis@@ appears and the damage suffered by the image is enormous . &quot;
the financial losses and the procedural shores of the sectors affected are milli@@ on@@ aire , especially in the case of luxury goods .
according to data from the C@@ L@@ SA market analysis , with a volume of EUR 15@@ ,000 billion a year China is , in size , the third luxury market of luxury and the growing rate .
however , achieving the ann@@ ul@@ ment of doubtful legality in the register of marks is complicated and it is also a lot of money .
the processes can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch talks about cases where the court dis@@ estimates a demand because there was so much time that the name of demand had already become a &apos; market reality &apos; .
&quot; if the complain@@ ant has bad luck , perhaps even having to pay money to the p@@ i@@ ter &apos; cause the process has damaged the mark of this in China , says P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
sometimes this is the law of the jungle .
some of the most known cases have to do with graphic elements .
in 2009 D@@ aim@@ ler @-@ Ben@@ z lost a ple@@ ad against the co@@ lli@@ ght construction machine , the company that has been absor@@ bed recently by the German bomb @-@ bomb manufacturer of Pu@@ tz@@ me@@ ist@@ er .
that is why the Chinese today can continue to use a very similar emb@@ le to the Merc@@ edes star .
the Vol@@ vo bu@@ yer , Ge@@ ely , used to use a blank and blue logo that I remembered largely to B@@ M@@ W ; the matter was addressed in the courts and Ge@@ ely had to amend it .
the L@@ aco@@ y clothing manufacturer lost in China against cop@@ pers from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a cro@@ codi@@ le looking at the original address .
the Chinese authorities do not feel guilty .
the C@@ T@@ M@@ O marks office in Beijing recognises that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staff .
last year , however , &quot; the situation of the workforce came back to normal . &quot;
in this way , the number of complaints process un@@ processed has been reduced by 22 % .
almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 of these cases were solved , 75 % more than last year .
however , 8@@ 1.@@ 500 complaints are still pending .
combating this costs a lot of money .
as usual in China , the figures are surprising .
last year , the C@@ T@@ M@@ O recorded more than 1.@@ 4 million applications for protection marking , almost a third more than 2010 .
it would be a new record , and it means that China leads to a tenth year the list of new constitu@@ encies throughout the world , according to the mark office .
it seems that this also happens with the number of valid versions , which amounts to 5@@ .5 million in total .
in 2011 , 1 800 million yu@@ ans would have been located in the concept of rights .
in other words , this means that by average , it costs 1.@@ 280 yu@@ ans or 160 euros .
combating this costs a lot of money , as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Fre@@ ud@@ enberg .
for more than seven years , the group fight against a Chinese imit@@ ator .
while the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of the car parts of imit@@ ation ,
the cat has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Fre@@ ud@@ enberg mark .
&quot; we ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the names are not protected &apos; , it says Han@@ no W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , President and Con@@ coun@@ sel@@ or , of Fre@@ ud@@ enberg Ch@@ em@@ kland Spe@@ ci@@ kland .
the C@@ T@@ M@@ O marks office also dis@@ estimated the resource of am@@ muni@@ tion .
in both the next two bodies , they have given the right to Fre@@ ud@@ enberg , but the opposite is still fighting .
we must be very careful .
now the case has come to the doors of the Su@@ peri@@ or Court of Justice , where the resolution is still pending .
W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler trust@@ s to be able to resolve the issue and the profession@@ alism of the courts .
however , it also states that &apos; the procedure is extremely costly , both in terms of money and of time &apos; .
it is difficult to estimate the internal costs ; the business file has had to review files of up to a hundred years of anti@@ age to be able to provide evidence .
five years ago Fre@@ ud@@ enberg offered the opposite of a &apos; six @-@ figure sum in euros &apos; with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement , but it did not succeed .
&quot; this shows how much we care about , W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
the dangers in Ex@@ tre@@ mo in the East threaten even to affect Europe ,
in particular , if the cop@@ pers are assured there are the rights on non @-@ protected marks .
so a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Fre@@ ud@@ enberg for shoes and fur products .
a long time ago the group abandoned this trade area , but it managed to prevent the entry .
&quot; we must be very careful , &quot; says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
both he and the P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch lawyer recommend that German companies be extremely cautious in doing business with China .
it is not enough to trust international law legislation , but what is to be done is &apos; register in China as well all that can be able to protect &apos; , as W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler says .
otherwise , the subject may be much more expensive than a simple register .
in fact , in case Fre@@ ud@@ enberg lost the last assault of his particular battle , then he would have to pay for the opposite rights of his own name , as he explains W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
that or the seg@@ ment in question would be thrown out of the market .
global fight against AIDS : dance , sing , help
in He@@ ide@@ l@@ berg ens@@ ings the red cor@@ p and in Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia , the AIDS orph@@ ans of AIDS are happy .
the story of a link capable of exceed@@ ing much more than 8.@@ 7@@ 33 miles away .
first of all , it starts with the dance : cow@@ boy bott@@ les , bas@@ ket@@ ball shoes , tac@@ lion shoes and mo@@ cas@@ ers are looking for the ground on the ground on the ground , and they find it quickly .
one , two , three , four .
only then are the voices of the cant@@ ers ( contr@@ acted , under , in line and so@@ da ) , de@@ vis@@ ing , ham@@ pering and following each other .
and Fi@@ ete Hop@@ f , the director of 29 years , threatens to get away almost from his loc@@ ker in trying to put in order to put in order to put in order with his strong and swe@@ eping g@@ anges .
it &apos;s Monday afternoon and in the music room for the M@@ ide@@ co@@ berg Institute of He@@ ide@@ l@@ berg in He@@ ide@@ l@@ berg .
the fifty singer , from 23 and 69 years , have also come from the human gen@@ o@@ st to the master of home .
&quot; O@@ m &apos;@@ O@@ ban@@ i &apos; is not an easy piece , every voice of the cor@@ oner has a different text , and in a foreign language barely known : the z@@ ul@@ u , a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa , B@@ ot@@ su@@ ana , Les@@ oth@@ o , Mal@@ a@@ wi , Mozambique and in some of Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia areas .
help for self @-@ help
according to an estimate of NGOs , the UN programme for the fight against AIDS , in the world there are approximately 34 million people infected by the HIV virus .
23@@ .5 million are living in South Africa .
in Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia there are 2@@ 4@@ 5,000 orph@@ ans of AIDS .
more than 40 % of the population is already positive .
the Vo@@ ai@@ an Partnership for Africa has found in Germany in Germany for 180 orph@@ ans of the people of E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni .
sevent@@ y of them to school school .
for 15 or 20 a month , a child can be filled .
this contribution will cover the tu@@ ition of school , the uniform and will guarantee a hot meal on the Go@@ go C@@ enter .
uh @-@ huh .
in this room no one knows about flu@@ id this b@@ ant@@ o language , but sing you know .
for ten years now this cor@@ ny songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes achiev@@ es them to their place of origin : South Africa .
at 8.@@ 7@@ 33 miles away from He@@ ide@@ l@@ berg , in the Nor@@ th@@ west of Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia , there is a town called E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni that depends on the voices of this German chor@@ us .
forty per cent is infected .
approximately 2,000 people live there , some of them still in bars and pa@@ ins , a large part of them are children .
more than 300 are no longer parents because they have suc@@ cum@@ bed to AIDS .
E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni is a small example of what affects Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia : the highest AIDS infection rate and the lowest life expectancy of the world , according to U@@ nic@@ ef .
the population does not see a good eye on the circum@@ ci@@ sion , a practice that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection .
more than 40 % of the inhabitants of Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia are the vir@@ uses of the immun@@ e virus , and to die with something more than thirty years has become normal .
for a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005 , the cor@@ oner discovered this little population , but what they saw above all were many children on the streets that were not only the protection of their parents , but of the main : food , clothing and training .
without school , the possibilities in a poor country are more than just a few .
in principle , it was only the particular compromise of a few of what was possible for a child to be at school and enjoy a hot meal to the day .
however , a year later the cor@@ oner founded the &quot; Vo@@ y@@ son for Africa &quot; which has since been organised profession@@ ally from AIDS orph@@ ans in E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni .
facts about sexual transmission infec@@ tions
what are the main sex transmission diseases ?
between the E@@ TS of bac@@ teria are the sy@@ phi@@ lis , the c@@ lam@@ dia and the van .
the most commonly ordinary E@@ TS is AIDS , the virus of the human fri@@ il@@ oma , the her@@ pes of genital mutilation or the h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis .
the bric@@ ks and the sar@@ na are among the E@@ TS transmitted by par@@ asi@@ tes .
what are the main groups involved ?
the sy@@ phi@@ lis and the gon@@ or@@ rea are more frequent in men who maintain sexual relations with other men .
the Robert K@@ och Institute part of the fact that at least four in five cases of my@@ fi@@ lis recorded in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men .
in the case of hetero@@ sexual adults , the most normal sexual transmission diseases are the infec@@ tions for c@@ lam@@ dia , tric@@ ky , the human potato virus , the di@@ di@@ di@@ asis , and the van .
the HIV infection between the hetero@@ sexual adults of the country is relatively small ; however , approximately 20 % of the new HIV infec@@ tions are registered in this group .
among young people , infec@@ tions by c@@ lam@@ dia are much more customary than in other population groups .
according to European surveys , three quarters of all infec@@ tions affect young people from 15 and 25 years .
in our country , the human potato virus is also added to the most customary diseases between youth .
how has the number of infec@@ tions evol@@ ved ?
not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to mandatory declaration .
according to the Robert K@@ och Institute , the number of mixed infec@@ tions has doubled its figure of 1.@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 to 3.@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
the number of new HIV infec@@ tions maintains a down@@ stream trend since 2007 .
approximately 2.@@ 7 cases were recorded in 2011 .
this is a tenth , less than last year .
what symptoms do you suggest that this is a ven@@ ge@@ ous disease ?
infec@@ tious diseases can lead to an oxy@@ gen in the area of genital mutilation , inconveni@@ ence , ab@@ domin@@ al pain , as well as am@@ ples or vegetables .
they often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and that is why they are not detected .
how can one protect ?
con@@ dom@@ s can reduce the risk of infection , but they do not offer protection to 100 % .
some path@@ og@@ ens of sexual transmission diseases can also be transmitted through infec@@ tious infec@@ tions and physical contact .
for this reason , experts recommend to be regularly subject to medical examin@@ ations , especially if they are often changed from sexual partners .
if they are diagno@@ sed early , most of the E@@ TS can be heal@@ ed and possible to avoid any delay .
through collabor@@ ations , donations and , last but not least , of the honourable Member who takes the cut for their actions throughout Germany , they come to collect enough money .
&quot; in total we have already sent EUR 200@@ ,000 to E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni &apos; , he says proud An@@ nette Len@@ nar@@ tz , chairman of the partnership .
in the people of Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini , a safe woman of himself and with leadership to ad@@ minister the money sent from Germany .
he is concerned that orph@@ ans find a good accommodation , for example with one of the ab@@ ats .
the &apos; go@@ ats &apos; , as is called the older women in z@@ ul@@ o , are the pillars of the people .
some of them have up to 14 orph@@ ans to their office , they offer them a ceiling where they live and they are concerned that children are coming to school every day and dressed with their uni@@ forms .
those who have no one left under the protection of Kh@@ any@@ i@@ oulos , a single woman who , like the two co@@ oks who are responsible for cooking every day for more than 200 starving children , will receive a salary of the partnership .
furthermore , &quot; Vo@@ y@@ son of Africa &apos; has launched a coastal school , has built two chick@@ ens and , in collaboration with the US health organisation P@@ S@@ I , has managed to make many of the inhabitants of the people subjected to HIV .
this is not obvious , since , in spite of the fact that this disease is in the whole country , it is not often talking about it .
a king with 14 wives
&quot; AIDS is an absolute tabo@@ o , &quot; says An@@ nette Len@@ nar@@ tz , &apos; because it has to do with sexu@@ ality . &quot;
something strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives .
the last total mon@@ ar@@ ch of the N@@ egr@@ a Africa , the King M@@ sw@@ ati III , is known by his lifestyle and re@@ ple@@ ent of exc@@ esses .
poli@@ sh rather than democracy .
this form of life not officially accepted is largely responsible for the spread of the HIV virus in recent decades .
but it is also due to the countless seas@@ ons that cut the country from one side to another and that they take it wherever they go .
according to An@@ nette Len@@ nar@@ tz , &quot; in any corner there can be free con@@ dom@@ s , but these are hardly used .
it is another culture , here only accept skin contact . &quot;
in order to promote cultural exchange , the Lat@@ on@@ gi cor@@ oner is trav@@ eling every two or three years by the south of Africa singing songs that speak of mel@@ an@@ cho@@ ir , a con@@ quest , hope and confidence in the black race , which many in the south of the African continent still remember of the time of apartheid .
a bus full of white people singing songs in a black language ; so much recognition does not only bring an excellent atmosphere and great joy , but it has also succeeded in getting a couple of tears to some other spon@@ sor@@ ous border soldier .
the journey leads to E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni , where the cant@@ ers visit children .
even though this little population is barely in the m@@ aps , in the River E@@ z@@ ul@@ w@@ eni Valley is very well known .
&quot; come closer to E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni , the light says the people of the place . &quot;
and after the 8@@ 7@@ 33 kilome@@ ters in line back to He@@ ide@@ l@@ berg in the Ber@@ gh@@ e@@ ć test foot@@ age , then we can see that it is also possible to see a bright light from there .
Mess@@ eng@@ er : NA@@ SA dis@@ covers ice in Mer@@ cur@@ io
the Mess@@ eng@@ er magazine has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mer@@ cur@@ io .
the ice layer will probably have a s@@ lander for 20 feet .
NA@@ SA , the American space agency , has provided evidence of ice in Mer@@ cur@@ io .
despite the near@@ est planet to the sun , there are also freezing water , as emerges from three studies published on Thursday in the speci@@ alized magazine &apos; Sci@@ ence . &quot;
the Mess@@ eng@@ er smi@@ ling would have found evidence that in the area of the planet that is permanently at the shadow of the shadow , a ice layer has been formed .
it seems that this has at least 30 c@@ enti@@ metres and probably even 20 me@@ ters .
the water comes from com@@ ets or , with a great prob@@ ability , aster@@ o@@ ids , which was at the heart of Mer@@ cur@@ io .
no one connec@@ ts the ice finding with the possibility that there is life on the planet , claiming the chief investig@@ ator of Mess@@ eng@@ er , Sean Sol@@ om@@ on .
the temperature in Mer@@ cur@@ io can reach 4@@ 26 degrees c@@ enti@@ degrees .
however , the findings could help to clarify how water and other components of life have come to other areas of the solar system .
in a completely uncertain way for the inhabitants of the planet Earth , the polls , tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es and small ro@@ bot@@ s like the Pho@@ eni@@ x are set to explore the dep@@ ths of the universe .

our window to the universe : the most important tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es
looks like the tel@@ esc@@ ope was invented by Hans Li@@ p@@ per@@ hey in 16@@ 08 , before Galileo Gali@@ le@@ i used to use a year later to observe the stars .
since then , the mirr@@ ors of the op@@ tical tel@@ esc@@ op@@ es have not stopped growing and the images they offer us have more and more depth .
for 30 years , in particular 19@@ 47 to 1975 , the H@@ ale tel@@ esc@@ ope in the Pal@@ om@@ ar Observ@@ atory near San Diego was the largest in the world .
your mirror , in the image , had a five @-@ feet di@@ ame@@ ter .

the mirror of South @-@ Africa Lar@@ ge Tel@@ esc@@ ope in South Africa is seg@@ ment@@ ated to save costs .
in spite of this , it gets a di@@ ame@@ ter of approximately 11 metres .
the inconveni@@ ence of this more economic construction is that the tel@@ esc@@ ope has a fixed raise angle , so its mobility is limited .
the H@@ ob@@ by @-@ E@@ ber@@ ly @-@ E@@ ber@@ ly tel@@ esc@@ ope in T@@ ears also has a fixed raise angle .

here they live the &apos; tal@@ y@@ shi &apos; , a people who do not know much , apart from the fact that they domin@@ ate the Per@@ ci@@ an and that they are very long@@ ed .
our final destination is L@@ erec@@ k .
this little city is assuming a architecture perhaps too m@@ aci@@ ly designed in the Soviet era and that it does not seem to fit into a mountain landscape as pa@@ inted as it is .
European tourists barely reach this place , since the road from Azerbaijan &apos;s capital , Bak@@ u , is too heavy .
to go to the 3@@ 23 kilome@@ ters that separate both urban dimensions , we need eight hours because the road is a single sense .

and if we take into account that the older man who is documented lived in 122 years , it seems that the age of Mu@@ by@@ ü@@ mo@@ v is quite suspicious .
&quot; born in the region in 18@@ 05 and died in 1973 , &quot; explains Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
the man was married on three occasions and had 23 children , apparently still had time to devise a more daughter of the age of 13@@ 6 .

it is a fact that , surpri@@ sing@@ ly often , the inhabitants of the region located around L@@ erec@@ k are often reaching a bi@@ blic@@ al age .
there are currently 20 people who exceed 100 years old .
why are they living here in the south , so many elderly people ?
the tourist guide F@@ ari@@ d F@@ ari@@ z@@ ad@@ eh explains that this is the special genes of tal@@ y@@ sh@@ is .
the muse@@ um director , Mrs Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva , believes that the cause lies in food .
however , from a nutri@@ tional point of view , it does not seem logical that the rich food in the cal@@ ories of tal@@ y@@ shi , which wor@@ ship meat , bread and especially dairy products and many of which , moreover , have a glass of mel@@ ted butter , is so healthy .
or perhaps it is the natural life that keeps young people in C@@ eng@@ em@@ ir@@ an , a little settlement not far from the city of L@@ erec@@ k &apos;s city , Ru@@ b@@ aba Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
its 97 years is relatively young for what is estimated by these heart@@ beat .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , who claims to have 14@@ 3 descend@@ ants , lives in a simple timber house from the entire Caucasus region .
sitting on the floor , it moves in an un@@ tir@@ ing way of a huge butter cake .
eight people live under a roof , including one of the children and a daughter of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , both became grand@@ parents long ago .
there are also two small children .
in the kitchen , I had tea for the guests , a tea that serve in a large number of typical ways .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s teeth are white and they are perfectly alig@@ ned and under the hand@@ ker@@ chief hidden two dark bl@@ ond hair bags that their son is proud of us .
I &apos;ve always w@@ ashed my hair with milk , that is why I &apos;ve never fallen and kept her color .
&quot; nor have I ever used a sham@@ po@@ o , &quot; says Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
pension is enough to live
he has always eaten only what he produced in his own farm : tom@@ atoes , potatoes and gu@@ is@@ ers .
in my life , I have never gone to the purchase of a super@@ market .
then he talks about his husband , who was in the army .
the worst was the time after the Second World War .
however , everything came back to his head when the &quot; dear father &apos; , He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ y@@ e@@ w , took control of the situation .
this kind of propaganda sounds weird in a woman &apos;s mouth .
however , in Azerbaijan , the cul@@ pri@@ ess of the nation of the nation , which runs its country as a dictator , does not know boundaries .
this was held in power until 2003 , at the time when the witness came to your son Il@@ ham .
at least the elderly of Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva takes 2@@ 30 man@@ at ( approximately EUR 1 000 ) in the form of a monthly pension , a sum with which we can live well with the situation here .
and perhaps the can@@ z@@ ay@@ eva son of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva is right : &quot; in our culture the greatest are respected . &quot;
they live in a great family , they are loved , receive all the necessary care and they are happy .
as if this wasn &apos;t right enough to stay alive many years ...
in the Constitution , the word &apos; Human Rights &apos; is missing .
the revolution has returned to Cairo .
demonstrations that make a difference in Cairo show the tremendous division of the country .
the future constitution , with sh@@ aria as a basis , is very controversial .
the Egyptian president did not sk@@ in@@ ny in pa@@ tho@@ sm .
&quot; we must overcome the transition .
and that is my responsibility , before the people and before God , he said in public television .
his speech was aimed at all the people , especially the Christian Cop@@ ts , the Liberals , the Muslims enli@@ ghtened and the phones .
all of them , un@@ solved until now in a confused opposition , are afraid .
fear of a the@@ ocr@@ acy of the Ni@@ lo by the grace of the powerful Muslim community .
as Moham@@ med Mur@@ si explains , almost calling for forgi@@ veness , the Constitutional Court &apos;s powers must be phased out temporarily and extending their &apos; to save the revolution . &quot;
however , neither the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans nor the whole world know very well what this 61 @-@ year @-@ old eng@@ in@@ eer is with a title of doc@@ torate granted by the University of the Southern California .
do you intend to deprive the judiciary ?
in fact , the 2@@ 34 articles , whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predomin@@ antly Islamic members in a night meeting of 15 hours , are truly worrying .
as in previous constitutions , in the draft also states that case law is based on the &apos; principles of Islamic law &apos; .
however , what does that mean &apos; principles &apos; ?
this was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islam@@ ists will take advantage of this vague formulation , as well as the scope of legal manoeuvre that has been taken , to impose a stricter interpretation of the sh@@ aria .
this is at least what is suggested by a new article : in all matters relating to Sh@@ aria is mandatory to consult at the Al @-@ Ash@@ ar University , the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great power throughout sun@@ ism .
it does not have to be that way , but this can mean that the cl@@ one would control legislation , which - in fact - would have a result of the incap@@ aci@@ tation of the judiciary .
large part of the draft constitution is open to interpretation .
what is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction .
during the dictatorship of Mu@@ bar@@ ak these courts served to exercise a hard repression on the opposition .
after the collapse of the dictator until 1@@ 1,000 civilians were arrested in military prisons .
as laid down by the draft , the state must protect the true essence of the Egyptian family and &apos; promote its moral and values &apos; .
it is such an im@@ precise formulation in legal terms that with the aid of this article the state institutions could even control the content of cinema and liter@@ ature .
of course , it is not something else that is about censorship .
by the way , no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women .
on the other hand , it prohib@@ its or cal@@ ming the Pro@@ ph@@ et Moham@@ med and its leg@@ ates .
however , it is not clear what an offence is and how it must be punished .
just as dubious is the wording that prohib@@ its the &quot; off@@ ending people &quot;
is it enough for the president or a joke on a le@@ ak ?
question of interpretation , as many other things in the draft that has been presented to Mur@@ si for their signature and which , according to his words , &quot; very soon will be presented to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans to be subjected to a referendum .
&quot; the revolution has come back &quot;
a few weeks ago , the opposition is closing ranks against the superi@@ ority of Islam@@ ists .
ten thousand people met in an unusual harmony in the middle of Friday on the T@@ ah@@ ander site , and tried to fail to fail the Minutes before it can enter into force .
&quot; the revolution has returned and will end up , &quot; says Ham@@ din Sab@@ ba@@ hi , who is in the third place in the election lists .
the Nobel Peace and Energy Peace Prize , Moham@@ ed El @-@ Bar@@ ad@@ ei , declared that the draft constitution should be &apos; in the trash of history of history . &quot;
through Twi@@ tter accused of Mur@@ si &apos;s follow@@ ers of wanting to lead a coup against democracy .
&quot; when the referendum is going to go to its pal@@ ace , and we will defeat it , &quot; says the opposition Jas@@ ser S@@ aid .
&quot; we are not yet tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been caught &apos; , it was referred to in the Egyptian media to the political opposition .
and several judges announced that they didn &apos;t want to monitor the referendum , so it would not be considered valid .
&quot; the Kor@@ an is our constitution . &quot;
for its part , the Muslim community well made an appeal to hold a contr@@ actor ; if not in the T@@ ah@@ anda square , it is after the other side of the Ni@@ lo , in the run @-@ up to the University of Cairo .
many women covered with a ve@@ il and supporters of the s@@ lav@@ ers took part in the same y@@ elling of : &quot; the people demand the application of div@@ ine law . &quot;
they demanded Mur@@ si to clean the country , at the same time as he said : &quot; the Kor@@ an is our constitution . &quot;
a struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic T@@ ah@@ ende , where everything started , would have caused a similar situation to a civil war .
it is clear that the supporters of Mur@@ si did not want to risk something that happened .
the Muslim brothers said that both those who oppose the draft constitution and the supporters would have expressed their high and clear views .
now there would be time to let the people decide in the ballot box what the country should follow .
in this respect , it seems that the draft Islam@@ ists have guaranteed the majority .
&quot; the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos; does not even appear &apos;
H@@ af@@ ez Abu Sa@@ eda is fur@@ ious with this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and including all the social forces .
this 48 @-@ year @-@ old lawyer speci@@ alized in human rights and chairman of the Human Rights Organisation ( E@@ O@@ HR ) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the dictatorship of Mu@@ bar@@ ak .
not because I share his ideology , but because for him human rights are indi@@ visible .
that is why it was beaten , condemned and imprisoned .
&quot; and now the expression &apos; Human Rights &apos; does not even appear in the new constitution , it is depl@@ ored in a conversation with the newspaper &apos; Wel@@ t am Son@@ n@@ t@@ ag &apos; .
the extension of Mur@@ si &apos;s powers to the three powers of the state made this lawyer res@@ ign@@ ised .
the measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead to Egypt a new dictatorship .
&quot; instead of strengthening civil society , what the president has done is to abolish it , &quot; it regrets Sa@@ eda .
however , democracy cannot function without civil society organisations .
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , also by the international community , which notes the ideological struggle that is taking place in the Ni@@ lo with a mix@@ ture of curi@@ osity and tension .
this could be against her .
a manif@@ esto in the T@@ ah@@ enda Squ@@ ings : &quot; you are looking at a monster that you can &apos;t control . &quot;
the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an rak@@ u@@ gi@@ an : the worst fish in the world ?
the five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of living , not only of Europe but of the world .
is it possible for the success of the country to keep a relationship with its appe@@ ti@@ te for an extremely ill fish ?
take a series of over@@ crow@@ ded qu@@ ests .
those in the middle of a mountain of dirty football clothes and wet .
leave it there a week .
it can then smell the paraly@@ se of the rak@@ n@@ k , one of Norway &apos;s ex@@ quisi@@ te .
I find myself in the small city of F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes , a three @-@ hour Oslo .
the landscape is a spectacular one , and this smell is always in the air .
the rak@@ n@@ k is a trou@@ bl@@ on in ju@@ mping water in water , depending on the evil that you prefer , to a year .
as it is dark and it goes cold , the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans come to a festival that is held here , in F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes , devoted to this man@@ ying of the most , so to speak , cap@@ tiv@@ ator .
&quot; eat raw and then drink a glass of a drink of a drink , &quot; says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , fire@@ man of the city that is also known as the &quot; General of R@@ ak@@ dy@@ k &apos; , which is responsible for organising the festival .
everywhere we see people eating this fish in small cub@@ s and drinking a significant drink of the drink .
&quot; to some people like the man who is more than the Earl , he says Hav@@ ard .
drink can kill the smell .
try some pieces .
if you can avoid it near the nose , it is not bad ; it is not quite different from a su@@ shi that has come a few kilometres in bus .
the rak@@ n@@ k is a product that comes from a very different time , in which poverty rose Norway and where , before the refriger@@ ation existed , fish were kept in the dark in the dark in water and salt .
later , in winter , when it is already good , it gets out and , of course , with in@@ active sen@@ ses due to alcohol , it is eating .
just a generation , thousands of Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans were forced to leave their country in search of work , and they mainly migr@@ ated the United States .
currently , the population is increasing rapidly ; more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by the abund@@ ance of jobs , high wages and a complete system of social services .
a number of people in Sweden , the old rival and until it does not too much richer than Norway , comes to this country to work .
the rak@@ n@@ k is considered something important , an essential part , even if it is quite ill , from Norway &apos;s past .
it is among the most expensive dish@@ es that can be bought .
but , in fact , it is all expensive . a beer bas@@ ket or a sandwich cost you the 10 @-@ year @-@ old cold .
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news and most Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans like that .
here people are still un@@ prepared to pron@@ ounce the name of An@@ ders Bre@@ i@@ vi@@ k , the extreme right of the right @-@ wing , which led to sho@@ ots and murdered 77 people , including men , women and children .
instead , they refer to the shooting as &quot; the event of 22 July . &quot;
the Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans cost them very much to believe that in their ap@@ prehen@@ sible country one of yours is able to commit such cruel@@ ty and murder .
after much of the current wealth of Norway , growth , from the beginning of the 70 , of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well , &quot; it says Anna , our wai@@ tress , as long as it goes bankrupt and that , with its long bl@@ onde , it is the image of Nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an welfare .
&quot; we are , as you say , prudent people . &quot;
your English , as the majority of people in this country , is im@@ pec@@ cable .
&quot; we don &apos;t like mercy , we don &apos;t like the holding . &quot;
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution ; everything , except a small percentage of money from this industry , is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
while everyone was wasting money that had no time for the financial crisis in the world , Norway kept the wallet well closed .
&quot; while we can ski@@ p in winter and make sen@@ ses in the summer , we are happy &apos; , it says Anna .
&quot; and eating rak@@ dy@@ k &apos; , adding with a car@@ cas@@ t .
I &apos;m in the snow making up to eat something ; I &apos;ve already had enough rak@@ oun@@ k .
now a bur@@ ger of al@@ ce is certainly something different and quite dirty .
but for the night , this evil fish is coming back .
the hotel in which I see it is one of the many local people in which a ball dinner is held in which you start to vote on the best fish , or perhaps the one that makes the f@@ ear@@ s test .
a television has been in direct line with a gift that takes pa@@ ins and that it is surrounded by rak@@ ur@@ k dish@@ es .
it looks like the Euro@@ vision contest .
&quot; what are your comments for the best fish there in the mountains , Th@@ or @-@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? &quot;
&quot; here is our point , Hav@@ ard . &quot;
there are laughter and applause .
a man falls out of the chair , maybe I can beat it .
or maybe they &apos;re the v@@ apor@@ es of all that fish .
Mexico : En@@ ri@@ que P@@ word is facing a hard start .
while the President @-@ in @-@ Office of Mexico , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ay Ni@@ son , is preparing to take office , the BBC , Will Grant Grant , analyse the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population .
the traffic in Mexico is particularly bad today .
in a city that , in the best circumstances , is already on its own , it has been inst@@ alled from Monday a ste@@ ak of steel that short of the main roads that lead to the city and which is causing enormous chaos on the roads .
the aim , however , was not to prevent workers from being able to reach their workplace , but to prevent the demonstrators from being able to reach the parliament .
on Saturday , the new president of Mexico , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ay Ni@@ son , will receive the presidential band and take the management of the nation .
it faces a complicated task .
Mexico has been able to achieve good economic results during the out@@ going government of Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is in a war against drug abuse that has already been charged by 6@@ 0,000 lives in six years .
&quot; my government has the great commitment to the Mexican people of reducing violence , &quot; explained Mr P@@ ord Ni@@ son at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States , Bar@@ ack Obama , in the O@@ val .
&quot; I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that objective . &quot;
before the president of the United States , the previous political experience of Mr P@@ word was as govern@@ or of his native state , Mexico .
a very populated state and a fast growth , which surround@@ s capital ; the views on the new leader are divided in this territory where he used to move .
a honest man
in the city of Val@@ le Valley of Bravo , for example , you are reminded of love .
their residents are given credit for the growth of tourism in the place and building infrastructure .
in order to get to the city , it can lead to one of Mr P@@ ord Ni@@ son &apos;s new roads , which is an enormous improvement compared to the ag@@ ri@@ et@@ ated roads and filled with b@@ ang@@ s that were rehabili@@ ted .
they can also see pl@@ ates with their name on the entry of a modern politici@@ ture and an impressive muse@@ um of the climate change .
&quot; we trust that he will achieve a real and lasting change &apos; , he says his friend and political ally Gabriel Ol@@ vera Hern@@ ández , a member of Mr P@@ ord Ni@@ son , the SA@@ I .
&quot; particularly in terms of security and economy , we expect the interesting and real change that our country needs . &quot;
after an in@@ interrupted period of 81 years in power , the SA@@ I was un@@ brid@@ led by Vic@@ ente Fox in the year 2000 .
Mr Ol@@ vera admi@@ ts that , after 12 years outside the presidential pal@@ ace of p@@ ine , there are many expectations of En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ay .
it also rejects the rating that the opposition makes a lack of substance of the new president .
&quot; it is a very honest man , very committed and with an excellent vision of the country .
it is a wonderful state of state and , above all , it is a person who knows &apos; .
however , on the other side of the state that is not the impression that has many people on their former govern@@ or .
in N@@ ez@@ ahu@@ alcohol , known as the N@@ isa City , the contrast with the five @-@ fif@@ ths of Val@@ le Valley could not be greater .
hiding under high high@@ ways is , in many ways , a sub@@ urb@@ s of the City of Mexico itself .
and the problems of the pal@@ ace are also tough and urban .
at the beginning of this year , the military intervention was called for to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in the bar@@ rels and violence against women is particularly serious .
in a par@@ aph@@ ic par@@ ker , on a garbage drain , they have been abandoned in only the last two years of dozens of women killed .
more than 1000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr P@@ ord Ni@@ son was the govern@@ or , a much higher rate than the City of Ju@@ ar@@ z City , unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous with innocent women &apos;s murder .
Mr P@@ ord Ni@@ son &apos;s critics say , in the best of cases , that he did not know how to deal with the problem of femin@@ ine while he was in office .
the most critical people accuse their administration of doing a blind eye .
in a home house , typical of the deteriorating neighborhood , Ir@@ in@@ ea Bu@@ end@@ cia has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photo@@ graphs of your dece@@ ased daughter , Mari@@ ana L@@ una .
according to the official version of the facts , Mari@@ ana committed suicide in 2010 .
however , your family believes that your partner was murdered .
&quot; when I came home , it seemed like you had cleaned the body , &quot; remember Mrs Bu@@ end@@ io .
&quot; there were signs that it was beaten and the sever@@ ity had already appeared . &quot;
as long as your mother te@@ aches history , a photo@@ graph of Mari@@ ana notes from the walls , along with a cross in which a single word is read : justice .
however , that is exactly what the family says he has refused .
&quot; the authorities of the state have treated me as an old spar@@ k , an Al@@ bor@@ ot@@ ator , a whist@@ le .
what they want is simply to accept what they say and that they go . &quot;
&quot; but that cannot be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence &apos; .
the presidential band that President P@@ word Ni@@ son will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the last six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during their mandate .
&quot; I hope that it will be the same kind of president who was when he was govern@@ or , says the Member of the SA@@ I Ol@@ vera in Val@@ le of Bravo .
however , that is precisely what the families of the victims of the world are afraid of .
Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning did not denounce mal@@ treatment , according to the prosecu@@ tors .
prosecu@@ tors are trying to deal with the allegations of abuses of Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning during their stay in prison .
the trial focuses on the period of Man@@ ning in the military prison in Virginia .
the defence wants me to get rid of the case based on the imprisonment of Man@@ ning .
the army &apos;s soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents .
the prosecu@@ tors tried to demonstrate Friday that the Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning soldier , accused of the greatest le@@ ak of confidential information in the history of the United States , lost multiple opportunities to denounce the bad treatment that is now under military arrest .
during the interrog@@ ation that the public prosecutor made to Man@@ ning in a prior view of the trial in F@@ t , Mar@@ y@@ land , the commander of Commander Ash@@ den F@@ ein stated that the records of the week@@ ly visits of the unit unit that Man@@ ning received for nine months of detention in Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia , do not show any complaints about the treatment he had .
the interrog@@ ation , which took place in a given light as a result of the request for the defence of the case given that its imprisonment had been hard and that it had already been enough , was a day after Man@@ ning had testi@@ fied that I would have tried to commit suicide .
the intelligence analy@@ st of the army , under arrest in June 2010 , is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while in Iraq .
later , Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks published the Internet material .
Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks has never confirmed that Man@@ ning was the source of information .
in view of Friday , F@@ ein checked with Man@@ ning the form@@ alities that the officers were following after visits to Man@@ ning during their arrest in the military prison of Qu@@ an@@ tico , where he was imprisoned in the system of maximum recruitment since July 2010 .
the officers would have asked Man@@ ning and noted their answers .
when Friday F@@ ein asked about the forms , Man@@ ning recognised that he described the treatment given to him as &quot; excellent &apos; and the treatment received in the facilities in general as &quot; a very professional &apos; .
the forms do not show any allegations of mal@@ treatment , even though the officers asked Man@@ ning directly about the treatment he received , he said F@@ ein .
Man@@ ning replied that he had expressed his concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had talked about these problems and they had told him that they would be treated , but they did not record these issues in the register .
&quot; they wrote &apos; without a catch &apos; ( after having talked about the problems ) but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems , he said Man@@ ning .
the judge , Colonel Denise L@@ ind , also asked Man@@ ning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the meeting that took place in January 2011 with a advice to examine the suicide intentions expressed in a months before .
Man@@ ning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the &quot; injury prevention &quot; regime under which it was .
the military said that they had put him under that restrictive regime , which is a degree below the surveillance of possible suicide , to guarantee their protection and security of other people .
&quot; I wanted the state to know that I was fine and ( I wanted to stop being under injury of injury , so that I can enjoy what , in my view , is a better quality of life , &quot; he said Man@@ ning .
Man@@ ning testi@@ fied on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Ku@@ wait , where he was held for almost two months before he was transferred to military prison on the basis of the mar@@ ines in Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia , 2010 .
he said he had considered suicide in Ku@@ wait and that he lost knowledge due to the heat .
he said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening or what happened in the outside world was very distr@@ essing .
&quot; my world is reduced only to the cafe@@ j@@ on Squ@@ ment , to that c@@ age , explained Man@@ ning on Thursday .
&quot; I thought I was going to die in that c@@ age . &quot;
Man@@ ning said that , once he moved to Qu@@ an@@ tico , the majority of days in a small cell , at least for 21 hours and often during 23 hours , without company .
Man@@ ning said that he was only allowed to have a plu@@ g , a blanket , some candy , some clothes and his glasses .
he explained that he was trying to move all the time , since he was forbidden to sleep or even lying during the day .
Man@@ ning said he always had a light from outside his eyes while I slept .
he said that if the cel@@ eb@@ ers were unable to see him when he was turning around the night , he woke him up so that he came back .
Man@@ ning &apos;s lawyer presented in January 2011 a formal complaint on the treatment of Man@@ ning .
Man@@ ning was transferred to the military prison of For@@ t Le@@ aven@@ worth in K@@ ans@@ as in April 2011 .
on Friday , the judge asked Man@@ ning about a plea that he had made in the statement of Thursday , according to which , after being forced to sleep in his cell in Qu@@ an@@ tico , he was forced to stand up in front of the cel@@ lers and other prisoners .
Man@@ ning had testi@@ fied that he was never given the opportunity to cover the blanket during the count .
during the interrog@@ ation of the judge on Friday , Man@@ ning said that he stopped the order that he gave him the cel@@ lar that he had to leave the blanket with which he could have been covered , but he recognised that he would not have ordered it to fall .
Man@@ ning testi@@ fied on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep in the last night because of an attempt to demonstrate to an officer that he was not a danger to himself .
Man@@ ning said he told the officer that he could have used the dramatic use of his under@@ wear or his ch@@ anc@@ ers to self @-@ inflicted but that he did not .
Man@@ ning testi@@ fied that that night was removed from his cell , his clothes and his glasses .
their lawyers have the hope that the judge will at least take account of the experiences that happened during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in the event of the declaration of war , which is intended to start early next year .
the defence said that it intends to make Man@@ ning declared guilty of minor crimes and to defend other accusations considered too extreme .
it is envisaged that the view is re@@ pul@@ sed this weekend and is expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified .
the P@@ ent@@ agon has maintained that Man@@ ning was held in accordance with the rules of application to be held under maximum custody in Qu@@ an@@ tico .
the charges against Man@@ ning include cooperation with the enemy , thereby provo@@ king the publication of information on the Internet , le@@ ak of national defence information and property theft or public records .
if it is declared guilty of all charges , it could face life life .
my Mexican @-@ American identity crisis
it says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities .
the Mex@@ icans tend to criticise those who left ; he says they remember the Mex@@ icans of those difficult times .
Nav@@ arr@@ t@@ te com@@ mits that the Mexican @-@ Americans are trapped between two wor@@ lds .
in a recent trip to Mexico City , there was hardly enough to go down by the rose and to the immigration area and I was already completely confused .
some car@@ tel@@ s indicated the way to two co@@ las : a &quot; Mexican &quot; and another for &quot; Ex@@ tran@@ j@@ ers . &quot;
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where to go .
having grown in Central California , throughout my life , I have called &quot; Mexican . &quot;
it is ethnic ta@@ sting , in the same way as my Boston friends concern themselves as &apos; Irish &apos; or my friends of New York are called &apos; Italian &apos; .
later I decided to &quot; Mexican @-@ American . &quot;
but this was Mexico .
and , in my grandfather &apos;s homeland , the plu@@ g or the plu@@ gs were not necessary .
it was simply American .
I speak Spanish , well enough to handle me during an interview in this language .
but I do not have the level of voc@@ abul@@ ary of a native and I cannot dis@@ miss my American acc@@ ent .
so I took my US passport and put me in the tail of foreigners .
I thought at that time that the elected president of Mexico , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ay Ni@@ son , visited the White House to meet President Obama .
on the agenda of the day , as the leaders of these two countries are meeting , it was said : immigration , drugs and trade .
Mr Ni@@ son was looking forward to the growth of the Mexican economy , one of the reasons why this is so likely that a Mexican will be in Mexico , as it is to go to the United States .
he wants to associate himself with the United States and Canada and create in America a commercial block of the European Union .
furthermore , P@@ ay Ni@@ son promised to continue to fight the drug car@@ tel@@ s in Mexico , although he did not give details .
for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of r@@ ud@@ der .
probably the majority of Americans never remember that in 18@@ 48 the United States inv@@ aded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory at the end of the gun .
but for the Mex@@ icans , who think of centuries , not in minutes , the elements they remember are everywhere .
so , at the time when a US official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico , you start hearing complaints , both in the press and between the Mexican elite , on how the Americans are holding their neighbours &apos; sovereignty .
and the children of M@@ oc@@ te@@ zu@@ ma are put on a war .
and yet , for Mexico , the relationship that really represents a challenge is the one with the most 35 million Mexican @-@ Americans who live in the United States .
are we talking about r@@ ud@@ der ?
there &apos;s a lot .
in Mexico , there are winners and losers , people for which the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not .
the only reason there is so many of the Mexican people living in cities such as Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Pho@@ eni@@ x , Den@@ ver or San Antonio is that , on some point in our gen@@ al@@ logical tree , there was a person , the father or the mother or the mother , and the father or the mother .
and most of the times that person fit in a particular profile : dark skin , a level of studies under a poor town , etc .
we are their descend@@ ants and we are loyal .
to Mexico .
and , although we are perhaps living now the American dream , having gone to good schools and had good work , we can never lose sight of what we are living in is that , the American dream , and not the Mexican .
sometimes our identity is not clear , but our loyalty is that it is .
it is for the United States .
moreover , we are aware that many of the Mex@@ icans belonging to the leader of the leader of the leader are not happy .
the feeling is mutual .
they see us as a reminder of a humili@@ ating defeat and they look at us over the shoulder as if we were from a lower category than is not Mexican enough .
our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough .
in his way , our existence is sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous with failure .
if our families hadn &apos;t failed in Mexico , they wouldn &apos;t have gone .
and now we would not find ourselves trapped after this se@@ dan cur@@ tain , living well in the United States but , like lonely souls .
my wife , who was born in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara and came legally to the United States when he was a child , reminds me that there is this ro@@ ast between the Mex@@ icans and the Mexican @-@ Americans because the first you know with more soli@@ dity who are and to the seconds of the world .
although it is a citizen of the United States , she is part of the two countries .
meanwhile , many Mexican @-@ Americans who know that they are not part of any of the two .
we love to hear the Mexican group of the North Ti@@ gr@@ es , but also Bruce Spr@@ ing@@ st@@ een .
you have the best of every country , but you are not up to any of them .
in Mexico they see us as Americans .
and in the United States we are considered Mexican .
now , in order to make things even more complicated , so I have heard during my journey , some Mexican leaders and some intellec@@ tu@@ als want to re@@ connect with the di@@ as@@ por@@ a .
they want the Mex@@ icans to work as &apos; ambas@@ sad@@ ors &apos; of Mexico , representing their interests in the United States .
we would say to our American colleagues how great it is to visit that country and pressure on political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico .
Yes , of course ...
that &apos;s not going to happen .
there &apos;s too little r@@ ud@@ ge .
and , with the inequality of wages , the gal@@ op@@ ing corruption and violence for drugs , many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re staying alone with this idea , friends .
it &apos;s fair .
if some Mex@@ icans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century ago and a half , then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican @-@ American people are still in a position to get their relatives a long time ago .
hmm .
maybe we &apos;re more &quot; Mexican &quot; than I thought .
old batt@@ les , new Middle East
the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be an unlikely basis for peace .
will there be a lasting peace between Arab@@ s and Jews in the Middle East ?
another blood@@ shed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain .
in the midst of the useless and regular discussions on who started first , lots of buildings have been reduced to the rest of the world , more than 140 Palestinians , most of them civilians , and six Israelis have been killed and , for the first time , mis@@ siles from Gaza , and for the first time , mis@@ siles from Gaza .
but even though the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be anch@@ ored in their former conflict , everything around the Middle East is changing .
the Arab spring has made it all pieces of shit or not , Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional arena .
perhaps this will make her fight even more bloody than before .
there are , however , reasons for thinking that the dead situation of this impasse could dis@@ guise .
a war that is not lost or won
at first sight , optimism seems very difficult to justify .
even if the ceasefire is maintained on 21 November , the clashes of this week have strengthened the hal@@ ts of both sides .
Hamas &apos;s leaders , the Islam@@ ist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will sign the Israelis to withdraw , even though Gaza has received a good beating .
and despite having killed some of his leaders and put pressure on 1.@@ 7 million inhabitants in Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated parts of the planet , Israel has not been able to end up with Hamas .
in fact , Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank , the other part of Palestine today , by its rel@@ ent@@ less Fat@@ ah , the most moderate Palestinian fac@@ tion .
in addition , Hamas &apos;s leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays its favor .
since Islam@@ ists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world , Hamas has made rich and powerful friends .
Turkey , a regional ren@@ ais@@ s@@ ance which had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel , has embrac@@ ed the cause of Hamas , and has also done so Q@@ atar , one of the richest and dynamic States in the Gulf .
the ex@@ ul@@ tants of Hamas say that the average Islam@@ ist moon is surrounded by Israel , from Lebanon to north , where the T@@ iz@@ bul@@ á party , through Syria , where the rebels in an increasingly Islam@@ ist trend could be defeated by the rebels in the world , where the rebels of Hamas are threatening the king .
above all , in the southern Republic of Israel , the growth of Muslim Bro@@ thers directed by President Mu@@ ham@@ mad Mor@@ si in Egypt , unlike the most popul@@ ous and fundamental in the Arab countries , has changed the balance of the region .
Hos@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ ak , the la@@ x la@@ x that ruled in Egypt for 30 years to its fall in 2011 , did not have too long for Hamas .
on the other hand , the M@@ usu@@ l@@ man@@ es are the main brothers of Hamas and their leaders depend more on the popular opinion .
in future diplomatic actions , Hamas may emerge as a leading player which cannot be excluded , even Israel and the United States .
meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hard wing will take the opposite conclusion .
as far as the military question is concerned , they have put Hamas on their place .
Israel &apos;s anti @-@ missile system has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas &apos;s mis@@ siles have been destroyed .
the Israelis will sleep harder ... for some time .
with regard to diplomacy , the United States is stronger than ever ; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the last wave of violence .
above all , Israel has thri@@ lled , especially under Benjamin Net@@ any@@ ahu government , a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process .
although the roc@@ kets used from Gaza have ended up with the lives of a 30 Israelis since 2004 , Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists , partly thanks to the barrier that the West Bank is having , the main piece of an aspir@@ ant territory to become a state of Palestine , and it protects the Jewish settlements that continue to rise in spite of international legislation .
Mr Net@@ any@@ ahu , whose party Li@@ k@@ ud has joined a group of even harder line led by A@@ 24 Li@@ e@@ ber@@ man in the run @-@ up to the elections on 22 January , is in a good position .
why are you lying to those innocent Palestinians giving them a state own ?
if they really were governed in the West Bank , would they not shoot such a thing as they have done in Gaza ?
it &apos;s better to have them after that wall and give them a good blow if they raise the head .
perhaps the hard wing will be imposed , although the Arab spring could alter its calculations .
although Islam@@ ists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciated Israel , their priority will be to deal with the internal difficulties .
Israel &apos;s defence budget is greater than its four Arab neighbours together .
starting a war with the super@@ power of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies .
that the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si has worked with Bar@@ ack Obama to achieve the ceasefire is a good omen and could make the start of something .
the Israelis should also think in the long term .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , depri@@ ving the Palestinians of their right to self @-@ determination means creating a po@@ v@@ in which one day will explo@@ de in the occupied territories by Israel , in the same way that this week was exploiting a bus in T@@ el Avi@@ v .
repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demo@@ graph@@ ics are worsening the situation as the Arab population increases .
the cross @-@ border missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll .
both sides need to push people out of the conflict .
the solution is still the one who pre@@ dict@@ ates sensible people from both sides , the most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states and the c@@ ession of the territory by Israel for security reasons .
the hope , small in the short term , is that the ceasefire gives a little more impetus to people who are fighting for this cause .
Egypt , which must begin to put a stop to the entry of weapons in Gaza , together with Turkey and Q@@ atar , is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on 1967 borders , with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem .
the Arab Arab@@ s should also put pressure on Hamas and Fat@@ ah to join .
that would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status in the UN .
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table .
during his first mandate he failed to present his own plan for peace .
again in the White House , it seems to be just as reluctant to devote its attention .
this attitude is a deplorable vision of future .
a stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States .
this means a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine .
the system of generic packaging in tobacco is in force in Australia .
warnings on the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases fight on a green dra@@ wer , which are the same for all tobacco marks .
the Austr@@ ali@@ an Act in the field of tobacco and em@@ powered generic , pion@@ eering in the world , enters into force and replacing the logi@@ sts and col@@ ors of the mark@@ ings of a green green off @-@ the @-@ board , terrible images of the body with child diseases .
at the exception of the various images and health warnings , the only difference between the draw@@ ers , compulsory from Saturday , are the names of the marks , all of them printed in a small type of source .
this is the most stringent regime in the world applied to tobacco .
the federal government of Australia states that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking through eliminating the features that make this habit have g@@ lam@@ our .
it trust@@ s studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before 26 years , there is a 99 % chance of never doing it .
&quot; it can be seen that children , even from very early age , understand the message that the tabo@@ o company is trying to sell through its &quot; , &quot; he said the Federal Minister for Health , Tan@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , quot@@ ing studies showing the logo of a cro@@ wn with the idea of being a princess .
although Australia has one of the lowest smo@@ kers in the world and that these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals , other countries are considering taking similar measures .
the tabo@@ o industry has exercised enormous pressure against the law .
the cor@@ heated companies said that the law would promote the black market in tobacco , where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible .
&quot; the legislation will have a serious impact on &apos; , &quot; he said Scott Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re , the British Tob@@ ac@@ co , in Australia .
it will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring China &apos;s counterfe@@ it@@ ers and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia .
others say that their business has benefited from the adoption of the law .
Sand@@ ra has , from Z@@ ico to P@@ ty L@@ t@@ d L@@ t@@ d , a small family company , said that the demand for pi@@ pes and covered si@@ li@@ con@@ s to cover the unpleasant images of the dra@@ w@@ ns had been shot almost two months ago , when the British Tob@@ ac@@ co , Britt@@ an and Japan Tob@@ ac@@ co , had been killed in the Court of Australia .
Mrs Ha said that Z@@ ico had sold up to 6@@ ,000 units , and that he was expecting more stocks .
&quot; for us it is a good business . &quot;
according to experts , the possible obstacle is the popu@@ lar@@ ity of the social networks between the demographic sector which is directed at the plan .
after a series of Austr@@ ali@@ an laws that prohibit advertising in television and the spon@@ sorship of sports and that they force most sel@@ lers to do no cigarettes , the marketing of tobacco has passed in line .
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites , but it cannot restrict itself in foreign pages .
&quot; if we trade tobacco and only this little window is left to promote your products , the online space is the most convincing place in which to be &apos; , Bec@@ ky Fre@@ eman , of the University of Sy@@ dney University .
Fre@@ eman observed an increase in re@@ views on mark@@ ings from &quot; ordinary ordinary citizens &quot; published on websites of social networks such as Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , Twi@@ tter and F@@ ace@@ book .
you can ask whether it is just a private citizen who really loves the Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o cigar@@ s and has taken the trouble to make a video or if any marketing companies are behind all of this .
the British Tob@@ ac@@ co of Australia indicated that the industry is focusing more on what the new regulation means in marketing .
the industry has even come to pay for Ukraine , Honduras and the D@@ omin@@ ican Republic to support the new rules ; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organisation that trade is being restricted , despite the fact that none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia .
the WTO is likely to dictate a resolution in mid @-@ 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k said that the government had had discussions with other countries that are considering applying similar laws in the field of tobacco .
in 2001 , Canada became the first country that introduced the requirement to include images in the draw@@ ers .
they are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries , including Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
in Britain , New Ze@@ al@@ , South Africa and India is considering implementing tougher laws .
in Australia many smo@@ kers are challenging .
&quot; photo@@ graphs do not affect me .
I just don &apos;t listen to them . &quot;
&quot; you take the cigarette and keep the package , &quot; says Victor El H@@ age while buying a package with the image of a tum@@ or in your mouth .
&quot; honestly , there is only one reason why I would stop smoking : for my daughter . &quot;
James Y@@ u , manager of the King of the Pack of the Pack at the centre of Sy@@ dney , indicates that uniform draw@@ ers make it more difficult to put them into the shel@@ ves .
&quot; normally it took an hour to dis@@ value a delivery ; now it takes four &apos; , says Y@@ u .
&quot; the government should have completely banned tobacco and then it is , it is over , and we closed the store , &quot; says while it is up to the top .
in a constantly connected world , it is not so bad .
during the day of the Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving of Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving of this year , I had to spend five hours on a airport because the plane in which we were flying a mechan@@ ical problem and we had to wait for another plane .
so I had a lot of time to think about the bor@@ ri@@ ance .
I &apos;m not gonna lie .
spend half a day on a airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring , even if you have the means to be enter@@ taining , as books , magaz@@ ines or i@@ Ph@@ ons , without forgetting the duty @-@ free shops .
but there are more and more academ@@ ics and experts in child development who praise the kind@@ ness of the boring .
according to them , it is all right that we both ourselves and our children are bored at once .
it is boring the brain to seek interesting options and may encourage creativity .
given that , at present , most of us are connected to this or that screen , we do not experience the benefits that the bor@@ ri@@ ance brings .
so , should we take a good look at the bor@@ ri@@ ance ?
Yeah .
and no .
but we &apos;ll talk about it later .
first of all , like many people , I meant that , now that we have more time for lei@@ sure , the bor@@ ri@@ ance would be a relatively recent phenomenon .
but , as Peter To@@ o@@ ey says , Greek history of the University of C@@ alg@@ ary , in Canada , and author of the book &quot; Bor@@ ed@@ om , &quot; to Li@@ v@@ ely confron@@ tion , is not the case .
&quot; in fact , the story of boring is very extensive , &quot; says .
at Pom@@ pe@@ ya &apos;s walls there are ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous photo@@ fi@@ tis on the bor@@ ri@@ ance that dates from the 1 century .
we must also consider how we define the bor@@ ri@@ ance .
&quot; the problem is that it has already been defined and discussed very diverse ways , &quot; indicates John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , Professor of P@@ si@@ co@@ logy University in On@@ tary , Canada .
after examining the investigations published and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his final colleagues took the du@@ ll as the experience of &quot; wish , but not to be able , to participate in an activity that is full of you . &quot;
it says that the difference between the boring and ap@@ a@@ thy is that the person does not do something but he wants to do so .
it says that with the ap@@ a@@ thy there is no desire to do something .
the main experience of the bor@@ ri@@ ance , it says , is &apos; the change of the attention process , associated with a low state of mind and a sense that time is slowly &apos; .
the pain may sound terribly like de@@ pression .
however , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood says that , although they can be connected , people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world , while people who are de@@ pressed feel that the problem has them .
sometimes we believe that we are bored , when what is actually happening is that we have problems to concentrate .
in your study , the Un@@ gin@@ al M@@ ind : De@@ fin@@ ing Bor@@ ed@@ om in a row of the report , published in the early September magazine of the White magazine , the Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues were referred to an earlier experiment in which the participants heard a tape of a person who read a magazine .
some groups heard in the con@@ ti@@ t room a television programme to all that did not keep any relationship , others listened to the volume , so that it was barely percep@@ tible , while the third group did not hear the audio at any time .
the group that listened to the programme with the low volume showed more boring than the other two groups ; it cost them to concentrate , but they were not sure why and they attributed it to the boring .
&quot; when you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task , the change of attention can lead to the boring , &quot; indicated Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , Professor of the University of G@@ uel@@ ph University , in On@@ tary , and one of the authors of the study .
on the other hand , when you are doing something boring , such as detec@@ ting defec@@ tive pieces in a manufacturing line , a music that distr@@ acts you can help not be boring . &quot;
&quot; in fact , we now know that moving or making gar@@ ab@@ ates , actions which are often interpreted as a sign of boring , can actually help combat it , as they make that person physically more alert . &quot;
&quot; investigations show that those children who are allowed to move learn more and more information than those who are forced to be held , says Professor F@@ ens@@ ke .
we all know what is boring at some point : the delay of a plane , a mon@@ ot@@ hammer , a particularly boring movie .
but some people have more to be bored than others .
in order to help medi@@ ate it , some researchers developed in the 1980s , a &apos; scale of the trend to boring &apos; .
the scale includes issues such as &quot; many of the things that I have to do are recur@@ ring and mon@@ ot@@ ton@@ es &quot; and &apos; there are so many things I am interested in doing not to do everything . &quot;
Stephen V@@ od@@ an@@ ov@@ ich , Professor of P@@ si@@ co@@ logy University of West Florida , states that , using such steps , researchers have discovered that the boys have more to be boring than girls , and specifically they need more external stimul@@ ation and more vari@@ ation .
but , in general , teen@@ ag@@ ers are a kind of group that gets bored fairly easily .
in 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ son , a human development teacher and the Community University of I@@ ll@@ ino@@ is , carried out an experiment in which to contact 400 teen@@ ag@@ ers and with their parents between seven and eight times a day .
he found out that 32 % of teen@@ ag@@ ers said that he was bored while he was at school or doing homework , while 23 % he said he was bored when he was not at school .
on the other hand , 3 % of parents said that they would be bored .
Professor Lar@@ son said that he did not know if the current percent@@ ages of the present , 21 years later , would be higher or less .
but he said that what he knew was that &quot; the teen@@ age is a period in which the bor@@ ri@@ m reaches its higher co@@ con@@ s , largely because of the fact that both children and adolesc@@ ents are not given a great deal of control about what they want to do .
so , back to my question of the principle : is it good to be bored ?
sometimes it is not , since , in the extreme , it can make us expose ourselves to absurd physical risks , as be@@ ts or fall into the consumption of substances such as method to combat it , as the investigations show .
on the other hand , many philo@@ sop@@ her and wri@@ ters speak about the connection between the bor@@ ri@@ ance and creativity , according to Professor V@@ od@@ an@@ ov@@ ich , who has been studying this issue for more than two decades .
&quot; the bor@@ ri@@ ance is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else , &quot; says Gary Marcus , Professor Marcus of New York University .
but the brain does not always know what is most appropriate .
if you &apos;re bored and use that energy to play the gu@@ itar or cook , that will satisfy you .
but if you see television , it is possible to meet you in the short term , but not in the long term .
so , if your son is bored and you give him an i@@ P@@ ad , it is possible that she can no longer be bored , but he will not have learned from himself , or to do@@ om , he says Professor F@@ ens@@ ke .
and &quot; that capacity of do@@ si@@ fic@@ ate is applied to other situations , &quot; points out .
your son does not only learn to enter@@ tain himself , but learn to monitor better in other areas .
I don &apos;t think we really want to praise the bor@@ ri@@ ance .
but we should not be too critical of him either .
our aim should be , rather , to feel comfortable with the constant rumours of the ongoing activities and technologies .
Professor E@@ ast@@ wood agrees .
&quot; to our way of seeing , we need to be bored more , but the boring is a very distr@@ essing desire and worrying as to link it to something that is worth &apos; , &quot; says .
it points out that what people really want is a way of dis@@ connec@@ ting and enjoying a dead time .
&quot; in an environment where we are constantly over@@ stimul@@ ated , &quot; says , &quot; it is difficult to find ways of focusing our attention when the noise . &quot;
Col@@ orado : without a book of instructions for the new drug @-@ consumption law
Anthony O@@ ro@@ I , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old student in a Community institute , and a smo@@ ker of south @-@ east Col@@ orado , faces a criminal process for something that will soon be legal in all the state : the possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana stones and a pi@@ p used to smoke .
I &apos;m saying that one day of September , he and some friends were driving for Lam@@ ar , in the near future to the K@@ ans@@ as border , when he stopped the police .
the police found mari@@ ju@@ ana in the car and a time after O@@ ro@@ I received a legal statement by possession of drugs and articles related to each one of the two dollars of a $ 100 dollar , which was reported by the date of the trial .
&quot; they treat us as criminals , &quot; say O@@ ro@@ I .
and are they ?
in the weeks of uncertainty following the vote that took place in Col@@ orado for the leg@@ alisation of small quantities of small quantities of mari@@ ju@@ ana for recre@@ ational use , the response in hundreds of minor causes is less dependent on the law than the location .
hundreds of minor crimes under the possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington , where a similar measure was adopted .
the police departments have ce@@ ased to present charges against the older 21 @-@ year @-@ old possession , which will be adopted legally once the law has entered into force in the next few weeks .
but the most conservative tax diver@@ ts of Col@@ orado have committed themselves to the open cases by possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and are still quot@@ ing people .
at the same time , several cities , from Den@@ ver &apos;s sub@@ urb@@ s to the Western mountains , are voting to prevent the opening of mari@@ ju@@ ana , authorised recently , in their communities .
&quot; all this is changing so quickly that I don &apos;t know what the next &apos; , &quot; he said , Daniel J. O@@ ates , the police chief in A@@ ur@@ ora , right to the east of Den@@ ver .
those who take care of the rules in the state of Washington are also turning around the matter .
and they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production licences , manufacture , distribution and sale ; all this before the deadline is reached , on 1 December 2013 .
they say that , for either or for bad , Col@@ orado goes ahead of the majority of states in terms of the regulation of the use of mari@@ ju@@ ana , first of all for stubborn purposes and now for recre@@ ational use .
&quot; Col@@ orado has a more regulated market , so it will be a good guide , &quot; says Brian E. Smith , the Commission &apos;s Committee on Budgetary Control .
but Mr Smith admi@@ ts that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work .
&quot; there is no real precedent that serves us as a model , &quot; says .
the Washington law , so called I @-@ 50@@ 2 , enters into force on 6 December , which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters , as the licensing system in that state will not exist yet , but the possession will be legal .
in addition , there are some sensitive mechan@@ ical issues that must be resolved during that period , such as the way to maintain a balance between the demand of the state of providing a &apos; suitable access &apos; to the authorised mari@@ ju@@ ana and its ban on can@@ nab@@ is in a less than 300 me@@ ters of schools , par@@ ks , children and children .
&quot; nowhere will it be more difficult to place a can@@ nab@@ is business than in urban areas , especially in the area of Seattle &apos; , says Ben Li@@ v@@ ing@@ ston , the spokes@@ man of the Centre for legal can@@ nab@@ is , a group of an inquiry created recently .
on 21 November , O@@ ates , the police chief of A@@ ur@@ ora , sent an e @-@ mail to his police officers in which he informed them that the city of the city would cease to intervene in court proceedings for the sake of the fact that the police are in breach of the crimes against the elderly .
the police chief O@@ ates said they would take care of the rules of the city that regul@@ ates the cultivation of mari@@ ju@@ ana with therapeutic ends and that they would continue to pursue drug dealers and drug dealers .
in the Coun@@ ty of W@@ eld , in northern Col@@ orado , the district prosecutor , Ken B@@ uck , represents a more stringent vision .
after the vote , it ensured that your office would continue to pursue the cases of possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana , mainly to press consumers and to be decided to receive treatment .
at present , 1@@ 19 people face charges for the possession of 56 grams or less of mari@@ ju@@ ana , although many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office has an obligation to intervene against those failures that at the time when they were crime , &quot; said Mr B@@ uck in a statement .
the answer has been complicated even in places like the rural coun@@ ty of Bureau , where voters rejected the initiative on the leg@@ alisation of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
the Grand Jun@@ loy police , the largest city of Coun@@ ty , no longer to adults by possession of small amounts .
Pete H@@ aut@@ z@@ inger , the district prosecutor , supported this decision , but it also decided not to dis@@ de@@ em any of the outstanding cases for possession .
&quot; I do not believe that it is wasting time to continue to enforce the law until it changes &apos; , said .
despite the fact that 55 % of voters supported the measure , it was never considered to take the consumption of mari@@ ju@@ ana for recre@@ ational use within the government and the judicial system to be easy .
the contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambi@@ val@@ ence between officials regarding the major environmental experiment in this state .
&quot; this is a cultural barrier with the district prosecutor &apos; , says Sean Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , a lawyer of Den@@ ver who represents the defend@@ ants for possession of mari@@ ju@@ ana and who is a local spokes@@ man for the National Reform Organisation .
&quot; it has been so long to bring people before the courts who , in fact , cannot accept that it is legal , said .
being the first states that consider the small amounts of mari@@ ju@@ ana in the same way as if it were alcohol , Col@@ orado and Washington are preparing to become the test cases at national level as regards the leg@@ alisation of drugs .
while lawyers and officials of the state have a new legal sales border , they are also anxious to receive the federal government , which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of mari@@ ju@@ ana as federal offences .
the advocates of the leg@@ alisation of mari@@ ju@@ ana have the hope that the Department of Justice will give up .
despite the fact that there have been some outstanding arrests of young people and vend@@ ors for therapeutic purposes , the federal government has allowed a majority of the sales of mari@@ ju@@ ana with these purposes in Col@@ orado , Washington and 16 more states .
&quot; although the anti @-@ drug agents are likely to do no lower doors to confisc@@ ate a small drug bag , they will probably be re@@ aci@@ ted to allow the functioning of regulated shops for the sale of mari@@ ju@@ ana for recre@@ ational purposes , permitted in the new law &apos; , Kevin A. Sab@@ et , permitted in the new law &apos; .
several cities in Col@@ orado do not expect the federal authorities to act .
even before the day of the elections , some local governments were passed dead on any new shop of mari@@ ju@@ ana , even though it will go around a year before any of them can open up .
last week , the Western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se was adopted a six @-@ month ban and it is likely that it will be adopted next week .
&quot; we do not want to get into a situation in which we will authorise someone and then we have a serious problem at federal level , &quot; explained Bob Nicholson , a member of the council .
&quot; our community voted against this amendment .
we are in favour of what the community voted against in favour of voting in favour of what the state &apos; .
there are a lot of questions here .
Pe@@ tr@@ on@@ ella Wy@@ att : &quot; I was stal@@ ked by Ox@@ ford to be a T@@ ory &apos; .
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t remember any time in my life where there was no dream of getting a square at Ox@@ ford University .
both my father and my older brother had been in which I was the best place in the world to learn , a Greek sym@@ posi@@ tion of the contemporary era that encouraged the two pillars of civilisation : free thought and tolerance .
however , to the two weeks of taking my place in the Wor@@ c@@ ester College at the end of the 1980s for cur@@ ing the history of history , I had already made the bags , which triggered the first scandal of my life .
my father collapsed and was shot .
my friends were dis@@ concer@@ ted .
the newspaper E@@ ven@@ ing Stand@@ ard said that I had abandoned because I didn &apos;t tolerate a number of college colleagues having sex relations on the side of the room .
the writer A. N@@ . Wilson announced that I had gone because they forced me to drink in d@@ aun@@ ted shops .
the truth was less fun .
I ran out of there .
Yeah , I ran , because I had been subjected to a systematic harassment and intimidation .
not because of my ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant name , not the fact that it came from a private school .
I was har@@ assed by a single reason , which in the one of the alleged revel@@ ation was somewhat intoler@@ ant and barbaric : my father , the late Wood@@ row Wy@@ att , was a prominent Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher and I supported the conservative party .
perhaps you ask what that is now .
well , several reports indicate that a new generation of centre students is suffering similar persecution .
the institution@@ alised and growing hatred of the conservative party students is such as Ox@@ ford that , last week , a group of them called for the same level of equal rights as homosexuals , disabled and ethnic minorities .
Conservative members of the J@@ CR ( high @-@ grade student group@@ ing ) of the Cor@@ pus are saying that they are &apos; often serious paragraphs , personally attacked and treated as people do not welcome &apos; for their political ideas .
they want to create a job in the Committee on equal opportunities for their college college to make sure that they can express their opinions freely .
his situation was not favoured by a recent docum@@ entary of B@@ B@@ C@@ 2 called &quot; W@@ on@@ der@@ land : Young , B@@ right and on the Right &apos; ( paradi@@ se : young , brilliant and right ) on students &apos; policy and that he was presenting the T@@ ories as an out@@ fit and to the T@@ ories .
he showed the pe@@ anu@@ t student Co@@ oke , expressed by the Association Association of Ox@@ ford University of Ox@@ ford ( O@@ C@@ A ) , in a Rol@@ ls @-@ Ro@@ yce , a silver suit , a silver suit .
in other universities , Conservative students say that they are treated as &quot; Turkish heads for the introduction of higher license fees . &quot;
Luke Black , 20 years and Vice @-@ President of the Association of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ingham University of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ingham , stated in a Sunday newspaper that &quot; there is an increasing trend in the universities .
people assume that we are like Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without even knowing us &apos; .
Sam@@ u@@ el Rober@@ ts , 21 years old and student student in Cor@@ pus , who put the motion for greater protection , says that this atmosphere is &quot; uncomfortable , &quot; while Steph@@ anie Cher@@ ill , as well as Steph@@ anie Cher@@ ill , says that the attitude of the members of the J@@ CR to the people who are right to the right of a right @-@ to @-@ right .
&quot; this is a threat to the intellectual debate of the intellectual debate , as well as for the welfare of the members &apos; , says .
during my first weeks in Ox@@ ford I was more alone than one .
I went into college in September 1986 , it was a young man of 18 years terribly shy .
hate to the Conservative Party was at its highest point .
the last year , university had voted to refuse Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher , former student , a title &quot; an honor@@ ary title &apos; after the cuts in the financing of Su@@ expertise Education .
the atmosphere would have made a shock to any Stal@@ in@@ ist .
during the early days of the week to the new university , when the new students know and know the cat@@ ed@@ acu@@ tics , I received a sample of the bitter that I expected .
I found out that the cat@@ ed@@ ec@@ tics did not only take a blind eye to the mo@@ ve that was made of the conservative academ@@ ics , but they took part in it .
the mining policy of the mining , privatisation and opposition of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa came to the ship@@ ments of the seminar .
first of all I was supposed to translate French texts from the 19@@ th century and I was not prepared for what came next .
&quot; miss Wy@@ att , &quot; he said the Catholic Harry P@@ it@@ t ( already died ) , &quot; please translate the first paragraph &apos; .
I didn &apos;t say one .
P@@ it@@ t , a tiny man with a face that seemed to be a mass of bi@@ z@@ co@@ cho , I knew well how to de@@ fu@@ se mal@@ s .
&quot; is it that the sar@@ cher@@ ists refuse to learn French or that , simply , they are stupid ? &quot;
the other university showed up .
my eyes were behind the tears that I was trying to contain .
&quot; I suggest that you go to French classes in your free time , always and when you are not too busy knowing people &apos; , it gr@@ ades P@@ it@@ t .
I came back to my room as a soul .
that night I sat alone at dinner in college ; then I felt a little bit in the back .
it was a second @-@ year student student named James that was presented as a member of the O@@ C@@ A .
&quot; I know who you are , &quot; he loved me .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s how it goes .
they get to be a suspect of being T@@ ory .
it is very complicated for me , but you know that your father is close to Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher , so for you it will be even worse .
a lot of new T@@ ories would appear to be Labour .
later on , in a local pu@@ b , I tried to co@@ gn@@ ul@@ ate .
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Th@@ at@@ cher said .
that trick was useless .
a first @-@ year student of Fi@@ lo@@ suf@@ y , Political and Economic Affairs which , paradox@@ ically , had studied in E@@ ton , said : &quot; you are a pig of a fasci@@ st pig .
you &apos;re contaminated . &quot;
other students took that c@@ anci@@ lla .
I became the dirty evil .
&quot; how do you have sex relations &apos; ?
&quot; they hit each other , right ? &quot;
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have been felt before the liberal law of the 196@@ 0s .
could one day take a normal life in Ox@@ ford ?
would I be forced to stay with people who think of me just after the night ?
would you like me to lab@@ our@@ y and sup@@ press my natural tendencies ?
the three years I expected were presented as a pur@@ g@@ atory of o@@ str@@ aci@@ sm and isolation .
the only thing openly T@@ ory was Norman Stone , Professor of Hist@@ ory Hist@@ ory for my college college .
they hated him to be not just the Conservative Party , but also consul@@ tant of Th@@ at@@ cher in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches .
I was barely there .
I stopped the place because I considered it an ancient and insignificant prov@@ inc@@ tion and for its acc@@ ess@@ ance to the mar@@ xi@@ ist vision of history .
in 1997 , it accepted a welcome in Bil@@ k@@ ent University , in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; here you are not gonna be happy , &quot; he told me .
I started moving on a daily basis from Ox@@ ford to my parents in London , finding refuge in my family and friends of me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan mentality more open .
I told my father that he hated Ox@@ ford and why .
he didn &apos;t believe me .
when he studied there in the years 40 , all the political views were accepted .
&quot; but if it is the best place in the world , he said with sad@@ ness .
&quot; they would never do that , not between my need@@ les .
even my communist friends had an im@@ pec@@ cable attitude . &quot;
his painful eyes started to cut off .
&quot; give him another chance .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;ve done it only to joke .
I would be the heart if you would leave it .
exhausted from so many journeys to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
a friend of mine , who also supported the Conservative Party , had suc@@ cum@@ bed to pressure and gave up his cre@@ ep .
next week , during a seminar in which another Catholic of history had insinu@@ ated , speaking fully , that I was a &quot; enemy of the people , &quot; I decided to do the same .
shame on the inside , I assumed my parents had &apos; wash the brain &apos; and called them &quot; old stupid &apos; .
the truc@@ e lasted little time .
it was my father who put the last nail in my career cof@@ fin in Ox@@ ford .
then my father wrote two week@@ ly colum@@ ns in Mur@@ doc@@ h &apos;s press .
my door was locked .
I was in the mood of fear and , last five minutes , my un@@ selfish fighters .
when I took the suit@@ case and took the first train to London .
I never returned .
maybe you &apos;ll call me weak .
but no one of 18 years should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hosti@@ lity in an educational institution .
what is even more tragic is that it was Ox@@ ford , who has not only formed 14 prime ministers of the Conservative Party , but , day today , hiding behind a reputation that is worthy of equality and freedom of thought .
&quot; Valent@@ ino prefer@@ s the eleg@@ ant &apos;
on the basis of the &apos; Valent@@ ino &apos; show , the cost of the cost , which has been opened this week in London , A@@ BC talks with N@@ aty A@@ bas@@ cal , Fi@@ ona Thyssen @-@ Bor@@ n@@ em@@ za and other famous sections of the Italian desig@@ ner desig@@ ner .
Som@@ er@@ set House , the former queen of Isab@@ el I of England , is the only place in British capital worthy of an exhibi@@ tion on Valent@@ ino Gar@@ avan@@ i .
the desig@@ ner has recognised it during the opening of Valent@@ ino : the master of the cost of the cost , a retrospec@@ tive apo@@ qu@@ olog@@ ist which brings more than 130 high @-@ hu@@ mp clothes created by his &quot; ma@@ ison &apos; over the last 50 years .
&quot; I love this pal@@ ace , &quot; he says with his un@@ mistak@@ able Italian acc@@ ent .
this sample is the place of a history whose only player is &apos; il nor@@ nor@@ e &quot; Gar@@ avan@@ i , but that it could not have been written without its distinguished cli@@ mb@@ s .
Valent@@ ino has always felt fascin@@ ated by the strang@@ ess and distant world of no@@ bility .
in the first room of this exhibi@@ tion , open to the next 3 March , private letters and photos with the signing of the bulk of the ari@@ st@@ ocr@@ acy , from Princ@@ ess S@@ alim@@ ah A@@ ga K@@ han , to Lord S@@ now@@ don , have been going through the Princ@@ ess Marie @-@ Ch@@ ant@@ al .
Valent@@ ino te@@ aches those personal memories as tro@@ phi@@ es of their social promotion : of hum@@ ble mo@@ dis@@ to of the city of Vo@@ gh@@ era , in northern Italy , in the middle of the &apos; jet @-@ set &apos; .
to be in love with the re@@ mor@@ ality has nothing wrong .
&quot; at least they don &apos;t turn out the co@@ lli@@ ts of their pi@@ ti@@ ts on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful cel@@ eb@@ arities of pop music , &quot; says Baroness Fi@@ ona Thyssen @-@ Bor@@ n@@ em@@ za .
in the 196@@ 0s and 70 , we both lived in the Al@@ ps and we were good friends .
Valent@@ ino is a spectacular host and has generosity and eleg@@ ance .
&quot; to all of us loved to be invited to his v@@ et in G@@ st@@ a@@ ad &apos; , he explains the ex@@ woman of &quot; He@@ ini &quot; , the in@@ tim@@ ate of a long @-@ forgotten , famous , sk@@ ir@@ t and Eu@@ gen@@ ie Ni@@ ev@@ ie .
Valent@@ ino has always preferred the eleg@@ ant .
and yet , it &apos;s a star .
Val@@ ia Maz@@ za , a Valent@@ ino .
the Argent@@ ine Valley model also fails to forget the char@@ isma of the mo@@ di@@ tus .
many years ago , after a par@@ ade in Pi@@ az@@ za di S@@ pay na , in Rome , we went to dinner to his apartment .
we were 20 people , including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy J@@ r .
in every detail of the floor , decor@@ ation , food , music , everything looked and felt its spirit .
&quot; to each of the guests made us feel important and dear , &quot; remember the &apos; top Tig@@ er &apos; , which started to work with him during the High Level We@@ ek of Paris , in 1995 .
&quot; it never comes from fashion because its desig@@ ns are art works , &quot; it kills .
dis@@ cord
Gar@@ avan@@ i &apos;s life is not a story of ob@@ part@@ ings , but of a well @-@ trained love .
he loves people with good education and better qualifications , and they love him .
one of the Som@@ er@@ set House &apos;s gallery has been transformed into a g@@ lam@@ uro@@ sa of 60 me@@ ters long as it proposes a change of roles : the visi@@ tor takes the place of the models and has to go to the Emper@@ or Far@@ ah , and it has to go to the Emper@@ or Far@@ ah Di@@ ba .
in that state of man@@ ne@@ on@@ ment , on names such as Si@@ bi@@ lla de Luxembourg , Gloria von Th@@ ur@@ n und T@@ practic@@ n , M@@ ette @-@ Mar@@ it of Norway , Ros@@ ario de Bulgaria or S@@ of@@ sia .
N@@ aty A@@ bas@@ cal and the mo@@ ot , in 2006
many of these guys say that the first Valent@@ ino is like the first love , &apos; impossible to forget &apos; .
I remember it perfectly .
it was a scre@@ en@@ jacket , a shirt , a gi@@ g &quot; gi@@ g &quot; and a collection of the autumn @-@ winter collection of 197@@ 1 @-@ 197@@ 2 .
&quot; it was a gift that he made me , &quot; says N@@ aty A@@ bas@@ cal , one of the thi@@ ghs of the desig@@ ner .
&quot; I prefer him on top of others for his femin@@ ity , for his great love to women , because he makes our beauty , add the old Fer@@ ia of Fer@@ ia .
I like col@@ ours that use , they have great light and they are &apos; donors &apos; to face .
the proportions are perfect .
the princess and pre@@ acher of Patri@@ cia del@@ la Val@@ am@@ pa@@ ola d &apos;@@ A@@ ren@@ ber@@ g@@ ola can never forget the first time that he had a Valent@@ ino .
when I was teen@@ ager and lived in Italy , I dre@@ amed of getting the age and the opportunity to be able to use one of your nights of night ...
finally , the time has come at the end of the 1990s .
I bought my first Valent@@ ino dress to use a party in my cousin &apos;s castle , Prince E@@ dou@@ ard de L@@ ig@@ ne .
it was a red suit , with a lack of vol@@ s@@ age , &quot; cor@@ s@@ age &quot; and the word of honor .
&quot; it was a dream reality , &quot; says the wid@@ ow of Ro@@ dri@@ go d &apos;@@ A@@ ren@@ berg .
&quot; Valent@@ ino is indifferent to fashion , his obsession is the pre@@ poster@@ ous , &quot; explains this Italian ari@@ st@@ ocr@@ at that lives between Paris , New York and Buenos Aires .
the Princ@@ ess D &apos;@@ A@@ ren@@ berg has his party clo@@ ses with &apos; the maximum care &apos; because a dress is not just a dress , it is also the whole of memories that entails &apos; . &quot;
the &quot; king &quot;
the great end of the Som@@ er@@ set House &apos;s exhibi@@ tion is Marie @-@ Ch@@ ant@@ al &apos;s girlfriend in his wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995 .
four months of work were needed and 25 &apos; s@@ ack &apos; ( as called the mo@@ oth@@ t to their pr@@ ay@@ ers ) to draw up that brown se@@ dan suit with un@@ speak@@ ings of pe@@ anu@@ ts , 12 different types of age and a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ a @-@ a @-@ half .
according to the Su@@ zy Men@@ kes journalist , the highest media authority , that dress represents a milestone of the high cost of the 20th century , &quot; the return of the high @-@ tech cli@@ ps &apos; .
I &apos;ve been able to get it for years with the &apos; s@@ avo@@ ir @-@ ê@@ tre &apos; of the elite , now Valent@@ ino is his best exemplary .
I dig up Great Cro@@ ce ( the distinction of higher r@@ ank in Italy ) , C@@ av@@ ali@@ ere from the Lav@@ oro , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of L &apos;@@ ord@@ re des Ar@@ ts , Coun@@ ten@@ ess , Gar@@ avan@@ i .
&quot; I have always drawn attention to your refin@@ ation , your calm , your lun@@ chron@@ o and perfect , &quot; recognises D &apos;@@ A@@ ren@@ berg .
the last time I saw it was a month ago in a show dinner in the Or@@ se@@ o of Or@@ say .
he was on the table at the J@@ acqu@@ eline Coun@@ des@@ ess , a great friend of mine .
&quot; it was un@@ bear@@ able , time does not go for him . &quot;
if you say a princess ...
the world &apos;s tough@@ est office : K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en &apos;s humans
for EUR 4 , the Indonesian vol@@ cano port@@ ers are playing the life and the health of 70 pounds of sulphur by means of stone .
there are people for which their work is a hell of hell and another , literally working in hell .
it is the case of An@@ to Wij@@ aya , one of the 400 min@@ ers who earn the lives of the vol@@ cano K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en , east of the Indonesian island of J@@ ava .
in order to do so , it has to go down every day to the bottom of its cr@@ ack@@ er , where the sul@@ f@@ uro@@ so gas which comes from the surface of the Earth falls into contact with the air .
after the start of large red rocks , which are in total even 70 pounds , it brings them in two bas@@ s of b@@ amb@@ u that burden on their shoulders through the sen@@ ses of stone .
it is only 250 metres to the top of the vol@@ cano , which is rising to 2.@@ 3@@ 86 metres of al@@ titu@@ de , but the ex@@ trav@@ ers take longer than 40 minutes in elev@@ ating the balance , keeping the balance and falling on the pi@@ ti@@ um .
you know that any trans@@ pi@@ é could save the life , as happened to a French tourist that took off years ago by the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en waves .
K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en &apos;s min@@ ers earn 5 cents of euro per ki@@ lo .
once up , it is open to the tourists who photo@@ grap@@ ed them as if they were mon@@ keys to circus and , in the light of the wh@@ ites , they have three miles away to the balance that a mining company has placed a little lower , at 1.@@ 8@@ 50 feet .
it is about constitutional Can@@ di N@@ y@@ zen , a company that explo@@ des since 19@@ 60 the vol@@ cano and , never better said , to their workers , who pay 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 5 cents ) by every ki@@ lo of sulphur .
then it sel@@ ls him for 10,000 ru@@ pi@@ es ( 83 cent of euro ) to the oil industry , as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture , fire@@ works , cosmetics , fire@@ works , and so far for sugar .
&quot; as normal is to load 70 pounds , we get out of 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 3.@@ 8 ) in every journey &apos; , &quot; it explains An@@ to , who is usually carrying out three newspapers .
it takes three hours in each and you have moved , but you will allow me to gather 13@@ 8@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1@@ 1.5 ) at the end of the day .
although it looks like a misery for so inhumane efforts , it is the triple of what would win in the field .
&quot; the car@@ er of min@@ ers is very high here , where the lesson of coffee is paid to 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.@@ 2 ) the day and the monthly average salary is two million ru@@ pe@@ es ( 16@@ 7 ) .
there , his salary was 7@@ 5,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 6@@ .@@ 2 ) to the day and the ta@@ jo was not so hard , but An@@ to has returned with his family to B@@ any@@ u@@ wan@@ gi , a people near the vol@@ cano , for a very good reason , in Indonesia .
An@@ to has as@@ th@@ ma , it is hard to breathe , and it is very difficult for the toxic gases .
to your 27 years , An@@ to has three moves on the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en , whose sulphur has already begun to pass on the bill despite a mask and special glasses .
he has as@@ th@@ ma , breathing with difficulty , and he is constantly getting angry , and his eyes are sh@@ outing for the toxic gases that the vol@@ cano is calling for .
it &apos;s the price to pay for your dream .
&quot; I will work two more years because I want to open up a shop or to study Spanish or French , &quot; promises in a more than acceptable English .
punished for life , this young man and intelligent , could be tourist , wa@@ iter or recep@@ tion@@ ist of a hotel , but instead of that do the work of a mu@@ g .
sharing an un@@ brid@@ led piece of wood with other carriers , it is up every day to the two of the mad@@ men because sulphur does not stop at night , when their yellow characteristic is blue and bri@@ g@@ ated in the middle of darkness .
by challenging the shad@@ ows , An@@ to low down with a little fl@@ ash@@ light with a small internal acc@@ ent to his hel@@ met , which he himself bought with his money .
a few hundred car@@ e@@ tak@@ ers do the sulphur bas@@ kets on their shoulders from the bottom of the cr@@ ater .
despite its p@@ ing@@ y profits , the mining company has not stabili@@ sed the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supply any equipment to the port@@ e@@ ators , who work for their own and the weight .
in fact , they don &apos;t even see part of the 30@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 2.@@ 5 ) of re@@ charging by camera that , along with the entry of 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es ( 1.@@ 2 ) , the bo@@ ots of this natural park are paid to the tourists who come to photo@@ graph the vol@@ cano and their human stri@@ ps .
&quot; this work is for the be@@ asts and not for the people &apos; , &quot; Mad@@ ru@@ sin , a port@@ er of 42 years who have been in the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en three decades , since he left school .
able to lift up to 110 kilos , it ensures that it will be working &apos; everything that can &quot; &apos; cause it needs the money to educ@@ ate its three children , between 18 and 10 years .
I won &apos;t retire , I &apos;ll die here because the vol@@ cano has been my whole life .
although sulphur bur@@ ns the throat and shi@@ el@@ ds when the wind changes from im@@ print and attr@@ acts the min@@ ers in the colum@@ ns that emerge from the vol@@ cano , they are so hard that they are not complaining about serious diseases , and that they are in the face of their usual respir@@ atory problems .
bas@@ ing the bas@@ ket on his back , Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k can only take 50 kilos to their 53 years .
every day , he and his colleagues are shooting 15 tonnes of sulphur to vol@@ cano , which three truc@@ ks reloc@@ ate to the war@@ ehouse of Tam@@ ans@@ ari , 18 miles away from a path of go@@ ats .
&quot; I will not retire , I will die here because the vol@@ cano has been my whole life , &quot; proclaimed Un@@ a@@ ini@@ k by opening the mouth , where there are several teeth .
from its five children , the biggest , 30 years , also works sulphur .
the time goes , but the misery perpetu@@ ates generation generation in generation one of the tough@@ est offices in the world : that of K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en &apos;s humans .
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
the sing@@ els are blam@@ ing the race , stress and cost of property and education not having children .
&quot; the Singapore population needs to grow . &quot;
I am a patri@@ otic husband , you are my patri@@ otic wife , we have our civic duty and we believe life !
it may seem to be to be reversed that these forms are part of an adverti@@ sement of min@@ ts , but in spite of that - or perhaps because of that - the video was turned into Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be in Singapore early this year .
the ph@@ ases are part of a rap that uses local references as &apos; we are going to put a ba@@ o ( B@@ M@@ s ) in the o@@ ven &quot; to laugh at the Singapore birth rate .
the advertising company that made the video , B@@ B@@ H , has the hope that with the announcement to draw attention to the problem of a funny way .
your creative director , Dou@@ g@@ las H@@ ami@@ l@@ ton , says that he wanted to use the power of music so that people can fulfil their national duty .
this is just the Internet , so we had to make fun and funny .
it is the biggest problem in this country .
we are the worst of the world in re@@ producing ourselves , so we feel that this was a subject that we had to address .
we knew that the government had tried many things , as to launch perfume with fer@@ om@@ ons or to organise rapid dating of dates ( speed @-@ D@@ ing ) .
many of these ideas may have been creative , but they did not necessarily work .
so we think , why do we not do the best possible to solve this problem , which is to put an rap ?
1.@@ 2 children
the one that does not take so far is the Singapore government .
it spend@@ s $ 1.@@ 3 to a year in policies to encourage citizens to have more children .
a package of government for marri@@ ages and parents gives up to $ 15@@ ,000 per child , extends maternity licences and re@@ share tax benefits .
but all this has had little effect .
Singapore is a rich and high @-@ tech state in south @-@ east Asia , also known by its leaders and its strict social controls .
the Singapore birth rate , according to its national population division , is currently in 1.@@ 2 children .
the last time he was over 2 - known as a re@@ posi@@ tion rate - was in 1976 .
so why do the sing@@ les have no more children ?
as We@@ i M@@ ing , M@@ atr@@ im@@ onian Political Director and Fami@@ ly Fami@@ ly , says that it is due to a &quot; better education &quot; and a wider range of career opportunities .
&quot; that has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities , beyond marriage and form a family , explain .
these changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the bac@@ teria , and to delay marriage and the born , which gives rise to a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore .
in the meantime , a policy of immigration is an end to drastically increasing immigration to deal with the reduction of the population has created res@@ ent@@ ment among the local population .
in Singapore there are websites where the xenophobia is barely dis@@ gu@@ ised against many new immigrants , particularly the Chinese , those who criticise to maintain low wages and not integrate .
the increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore government in Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence .
since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with quotas and higher charges for foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
while the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth in a nation , tax revenue , health costs and immigration policies , the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences .
the government tries not to build so many small houses .
for example , it has started to affect the estate sector .
the urban development authority has come to control the number of small apar@@ t@@ ments , known as &apos; shoe box &apos; , which can be built in certain areas of the city .
these apar@@ t@@ ments have 46 feet square and have been very successful .
however , there are concerns that they can promote a lifestyle of bac@@ teria and discourage the developing companies who want to build large houses , family .
but L@@ im Ye@@ w So@@ on So@@ on , Director @-@ General of the estate company , is saying that their &apos; shoe boxes &apos; are sold much faster than the larger units .
they are more popular , in the sense that units are exhausted days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
this makes it much better for our box of box .
however , it admi@@ ts that the new rules provide clearer guidelines for the development of those who were put in place if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project .
too str@@ ained too
Singapore is a state .
while these new rules can be a step towards the increase in the birth rate of national birth , speaking with the uni@@ qu@@ ans who work in the financial district of the centre seemed to have no effect .
&quot; people are very str@@ ained , houses are expensive , and it is also education , so many people are holding it , &quot; says a young executive .
other people can have children .
&quot; but for me it is important to have my own money and time &apos; , it says another young woman of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
men and women mention their career , stress and cost of property and education as the reasons they prevent them from having children .
so , as the government tries to push its citizens to have children , when it comes to making babies , the sing@@ les are those who have the last word .
private line is private on line .
privacy .
according to the Royal Academ@@ y of the Royal Academ@@ y , it is about private insurance or the area of private life that is entitled to protect any interference . &quot;
what is private for a less 16 ?
how does this definition apply in its daily life and in the social networks ?
do you understand the dangers that are exposed to the Internet in situations which I would surely not share out of line ?
I inter@@ viewed five boys from 10 and 15 years old , frequent users of the network .
in four of the cases , they associate the term &quot; something very mine , &quot; at the personal level , and &apos; in the key and name of the user &apos; , when they applied to social networks .
&quot; my deepest secrets do not bring them to a post @-@ post , &quot; it says Jor@@ ge , ten years , when he tries to explain the meaning of private in places like F@@ ace@@ book , Twi@@ tter , Hot@@ mail and Win@@ do@@ ws Li@@ ve Mess@@ eng@@ er .
&quot; they are very secret secrets , my mom can meet them , but not everyone says .
in F@@ B , beautiful images or games .
I also have my acqua@@ int@@ ance .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t share a picture that is not mine , or someone who is making the ridiculous &apos; , says .
the child recognises that it is wrong to publish ob@@ scene photo@@ graphs , naked people , crimes or to write humili@@ ating comments or violent comments .
Jor@@ ge ensures the 35 friends who have in F@@ B and his nine follow@@ ers in Twi@@ tter .
most are relatives .
the mother is included , he has the key to one of the accounts .
I opened Twi@@ tter to express me and write interesting .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re telling me , I just sub@@ p &apos; , add .
&quot; social networks are enter@@ taining , I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends quickly , &quot; indicates .
no doubt that I would never accept a request for a person unknown .
I wouldn &apos;t listen to anyone who recommended a stranger .
the case of José , 14 years , is different .
the teen@@ ager has an open accounts in Hot@@ mail , F@@ ace@@ book , my Space Space and As@@ k , in this last admit not to meet 20 of the added people in their list of friends .
&quot; don &apos;t scare me , &apos; cause we have something in common , music for example .
according to the boy , none of them have been prepared or asked to address his house or his phone number .
&quot; if you were pres@@ su@@ ing me or I would ask you to give me my own account , &quot; it recognises .
José was followed by As@@ k , after reading a recommendation in Twi@@ tter .
the boy is not aware of the experiences of what is known as cy@@ ber@@ bull@@ ying .
a known friend of my friend was extor@@ ting him in a social network .
they threatened him and demanded money .
&quot; never knew who was &quot; , &quot; ensures .
the victim , according to José , did not close the bill .
&quot; just put him privacy . &quot;
then it explains a series of steps to shape the bill safely .
unlike Jor@@ ge , this guy would have known pictures of known in awkward or embarrassing situations .
Yes , I would do it if I fall wrong or I &apos;ll take it .

key questions
Mari@@ anne Por@@ ras , English teacher and liqu@@ ored in education and A@@ pr@@ im@@ z@@ age , considers that to guide children and adolesc@@ ents must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to be informed .
&quot; the Internet arose as a means of looking for information , but with the parking site of these sites , it mentions the rules of the game .
por@@ k points out that the Mar@@ c P@@ ren@@ sky academ@@ ics , mas@@ ster in ped@@ ag@@ og@@ y by the University of Y@@ ale and the author of the N@@ ative and digital Federation , showed these terms to explain the phenomenon .
digital n@@ atives are them , children and young people born with technology .
&quot; we are the digital immigrants we have to teach them , when we are still learning &apos; , says .
he says that the issue is complex , &apos; because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what it is worth or not to dissemin@@ ate , publish or to say an age that does not do that . &quot;
&quot; that they are selective when what matters most is popular , having thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences &apos; , adds .
according to the specialist , the most effective way to teach children and adolesc@@ ents is through questions that make them reflect .
&quot; tell them not to do it . &quot;
then , Por@@ t@@ age , some options : there are things that you wouldn &apos;t tell a stranger , why do you do it on the Internet ?
or would you like me to publish a picture of you as you published from a friend ?
do you know what the others are publishing on you ?
when pictures of party holidays , did you ask the other people to label them ?
and one more , everyone needs to know what you &apos;re doing every moment ?
another point is to see that they have to act on line as they do off line .
they are the same rules .
&quot; one outside the Internet acts with respect , mor@@ ality and other principles , it must be in the social networks &apos; .
surveillance
I was a professor of primary school and educational advi@@ ses , and instruc@@ tor , com@@ mits to the fact that the family &apos;s parents read the social networks &apos; policies .
in understanding each of the inci@@ tions they have solid foundations for talking with their children about the implications of opening up on the Internet .
&quot; for example , age and what is allowed to share or publish &apos; , says .
according to Guar@@ dia , it is key to remind children of the lesson of &quot; don &apos;t talk to strang@@ ers . &quot;
it fin@@ alis@@ es Un@@ asu@@ r Summit without making the L@@ ima Declaration public .
the EU @-@ US presidential summit of South America ( Un@@ asu@@ r ) concluded today in Per@@ u without public declaration of L@@ ima , announced previously and theore@@ tically signed by the seven deleg@@ ates assistants .
Ann@@ e tried in repeated opportunities to access the document signed in the Sixth Re@@ union of Heads of State of State and Government of Un@@ asu@@ r , but the sources of C@@ anci@@ ll@@ ery and Presidency pointed out at a start that at some point it will be published in the Lib@@ u@@ an Government &apos;s website .
to be consulted by the text , pointed out that the content had been exposed by the President of Per@@ u , O@@ ll@@ anta Hu@@ bad , during a few brief statements to the press .
the access of journalists to the summit was restricted at all times .
during the day alone it was passed , in the press room , the un@@ sound video of the presidential assembly with the message &apos; private , audio @-@ restricted &apos; .
the little information that was circul@@ ated between the re@@ porters was delivered by the press port@@ ers of some of the governments of the Un@@ asu@@ r assistants to date , although not the loser .
the only document provided for during the time was the list of presidents of assistants , which caused the inconveni@@ ence of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that demanded greater data .
then the Per@@ u Presidency sent an e @-@ mail to the media with the &apos; final declaration &apos; of the summit , but it is the statement of Hu@@ bad , and not the official document that closed the summit .
in October last year , Per@@ u was the host of the South @-@ American Summit of the South @-@ Republic of the United Kingdom ( A@@ SP@@ A ) , and on that occasion , despite being repeated by the press , it was also not published by the press .
in A@@ SP@@ A &apos;s official website , it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday .
in both international dates , the authorities were trying to ensure that there were systems of transmission for all journalists , but they limited the full information .
the summit also concluded the joint commitment of Chile and Per@@ u to accept a failure of the Hague Court which runs a different border between the two countries .
the Presidents of Per@@ u , O@@ ll@@ anta Hu@@ bad , and Chile , Sebastian Pi@@ ñ@@ era , met during the regional date and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the IC@@ J , which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both sides , in the process that the L@@ ima presented against Santi@@ ago .
&quot; we will act and execu@@ te the judgment that defines the differences that we are currently taking in this international court , &quot; said Hu@@ bad , along with his half @-@ hear@@ ted .
&quot; Chile has been , it is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law , the peaceful solution of the disputes , of the treaties and the international courts , &quot; added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , and welcomed a tight hand of hands , along with the flags of the two countries .
the confirmation of both presidents that the IC@@ J will be subject to the IC@@ J , after Colombia reported this week the Bo@@ dro@@ á Pact for which he had accepted the failures of that international court , after a decision on sea limits with Nicaragua .
the summit was conducted with the in@@ surg@@ ences of the Presidents of Brazil , D@@ il@@ ma Rou@@ se@@ ff ; Venezuela , Hugo Chávez ; Bolivia , E@@ vo Mor@@ ales ; and Argentina , Cri@@ stina Kir@@ ch@@ ner .
Par@@ agu@@ ay , suspended from Un@@ asu@@ r since 2011 after the removal of his former President Fern@@ ando Lu@@ go , did not participate in the date .
the host president , O@@ ll@@ anta Hu@@ bad , was the manager of opening up discussions in the morning and closing the summit , shortly after noon .
the text read the final document in which it reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects between the Swiss countries for a total of USD 17 billion in investments .
among the agreements adopted mentioned that the countries of U@@ NA@@ S@@ UR will give &apos; important steps towards the goal of a Swiss citizenship for what we are expanding the agreements on residence . &quot;
he reported that action is being made to improve the cooperation in the fight against public insecurity and against organised crime , actions to make medicines more accessible , access to the Internet under the price of South America , and in a joint and efficient manner .
with a Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation ( from Latin America ) must not have a trium@@ ph@@ able , but must serve to extend a productive , productive new future for our peoples , &quot; added Hu@@ bad .
&quot; we have decided to give a group of 31 flag@@ ship projects that will improve the connection of the southern American sp@@ aces , especially in rural areas and on borders , bringing our countries and creating new economic circu@@ its , &quot; he said the President @-@ in @-@ Office in a read .
among those projects , he mentioned that five correspond to Per@@ u , and they are located on the trans@@ ver@@ cial ax@@ es of their territory , from the coast to Brazil , and two points to greater connection with Ecu@@ ador , even though it did not give greater details .
the final document also mentioned the political situation in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
&quot; we hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to re@@ join the Union of South America , which is currently excluded .
the need for Latin America to stay as a region of prosperity and peace , integrated , and good relations between neighbours , was one of the issues highlighted by the summit .
in this respect , the President of Colombia , Juan Manuel Santos , said before initiating his participation in the regional date I expected to meet with his couple of Nicaragua , Daniel Ortega , on Saturday in order to deal with the discrep@@ ancy after a failure of the IC@@ J .
&quot; tomorrow morning ( Saturday ) it may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega , he said Santos .
&quot; we are going to review all these paths , they are not exclusive , including the Treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua , &quot; underlined .
&quot; with President Ortega I hope to be able to tell you that we will handle this in the most civilised and respectful way , added Santos .
Santos and Ortega would be the Saturday in Mexico where they intend to attend the command of the new president of that country , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ay .
furthermore , as part of the summit , the negotiating ministers met previously to approve the year 2013 Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecu@@ ador , Per@@ u , Brazil , Uruguay , Venezuela , Chile , Gu@@ y@@ ana , Sur@@ in@@ am and Par@@ agu@@ ay , even if the last country is suspended .
Per@@ u has the presidency of the regional block .
&quot; South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship &quot;
the President of Ecu@@ ador , Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &apos; South America , in this case , must learn from Europe &apos; .
I have to say that , in L@@ ima , it declared the state TV Per@@ u that Europeans &apos; were killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts , &quot; but now they are practically a country &apos; .
he defended , in that sense , the project to establish American citizenship which encourages the Member States of Un@@ asu@@ r .
the free mobility of citizens and workers must be achieved by any country , as is already the case with the An@@ dean Community , but there are still re@@ action@@ ary sectors that we want to return to the past , warned .
the President @-@ in @-@ Office was also in favour of the re@@ wards of the United States Organisation ( O@@ EA ) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Ang@@ lo states and taking into account those who signed the San José Pact on human rights .
those who are going to be happy never commit to anything and , instead , the Americans signed it all .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the Internal American Human Rights Commission is in Washington under the financing of the United States &apos; , stated in reference to political asylum by Ecu@@ ador to the foun@@ der of Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks , Julian Ass@@ ange .
it has ensured that it is not regrett@@ ed by that decision because it has not betrayed its principles , but has respected its &apos; profound democratic values and human rights &apos; .
he added that , at the time , &quot; there were suspici@@ ons that Ass@@ ange was extrad@@ ited to a third country and not respected his process . &quot;
he critici@@ zed , moreover , Swedish justice to demand that it be put in their territory to interrog@@ ation by a alleged sexual offence when &quot; the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out by video video , which could be done from the Ecu@@ ador emb@@ assy in London . &quot;
he said that there is a risk that the physical and mental health of Ass@@ ange will deterior@@ ate .
&quot; I have not spoken to him since he is in our emb@@ assy , but the emb@@ assy informed me that he had a little pul@@ mon@@ ar problem , nothing serious &apos; , he said the equ@@ ator .
what is in fact is the danger that their physical and mental health will deterior@@ ate for being locked in a small area without the free air .
&quot; that complic@@ ates the health of any person , &quot; added .
it has pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange from June in the South @-@ East emb@@ assy in London , through the granting of a shower that will allow Ecu@@ ador to travel to Ecu@@ ador , is in the hands of Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities , and underlined that there have been talks with London in search of a settlement of the Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks foun@@ der .
we do not negotiate with human rights , that word does not use it in this case , but there has been permanent talks .
&quot; the solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain , Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Ass@@ ange , Bal@@ ta@@ zar Gar@@ vot@@ ation , is making a series of procedures in different European bodies , &quot; mentioned .
and he felt that &quot; if Great Britain gives this to the end of the day &apos; .
and if Sweden , as it is perfectly possible for its legislation and as it has done in other cases , I interrog@@ ate Mr Ass@@ ange in the Catal@@ an emb@@ assy in London or interrog@@ ates Sk@@ y@@ pe tomorrow .
it took advantage of it to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of the press and that it did not tolerate what I do not tolerate is &quot; medi@@ oc@@ rity , the bad faith and the lie , which are un@@ healthy . &quot;
&quot; the greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the evil and evil politicians but bad journalists on the basis of profit , blackmail and extor@@ tion &apos; , said .
in that respect , it was welcomed that they are no longer these journalists &apos; or the ban@@ kers or the h@@ eg@@ em@@ otic countries who domin@@ ate Ecu@@ ador , and brought forward to be re@@ elected in the revolution to continue the way and the right direction . &quot;
it also supported the decision to maintain the veto to Par@@ agu@@ ay in Un@@ asu@@ r at least to its forthcoming elections , to argue that the body &apos; must be firm and not toler@@ ating the opportun@@ ism and the re@@ dressed of legality &apos; because in reality &apos; wrec@@ ked the legitimacy of democracy . &quot;
the President @-@ in @-@ Office considered , moreover , &quot; perfectly relevant &quot; the desire of his Colom@@ bian counter@@ part , Juan Manuel Santos , to negotiate with Nicaragua now with the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice , which benefited from nic@@ ar@@ ag@@ ü@@ guin maritime sovereignty .
for the time being , that failure is not being held .
it is a problem between a Swiss country and a Central American .
conflicts are inevitable , but they must be overcome by the will to walk together .
it must be processed in a broad way to overcome them and continue .
he also trusted a good conclusion of the dispute by sea limits that keep in the same court Per@@ u and Chile , and he felt that &apos; it is right for Latin America to seek international law if the two countries commit themselves to accepting failure . &quot;
in reference to the eventu@@ ality that is being presented as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecu@@ ador to seek a third consecu@@ tive mandate he said that he sees that possibility &apos; with a great deal of optimism and joy , even though it is rather harsh . &quot;
it made sure that if it loses the February 2013 elections , it will withdraw from public life .
personally , I have never been interested in the power , but in such unfair situations as of Ecu@@ ador that socio @-@ economic poverty can only be corrected from political power .
&quot; my po@@ lli@@ tic movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that likely victory , because we have to accept that re@@ prehen@@ sab@@ ility , &quot; he said .
to win it would be my last period in the presidency and there we go out of public life .
if we lose the same .
&quot; it &apos;s a decision , &quot; he said .
it also referred to the new health treatment of the Venez@@ uel@@ an President Hugo Chávez in Cuba .
I just spoke to the Venez@@ uel@@ an Vice @-@ President Nic@@ ol@@ an Mad@@ uro and he tells me that he travelled to a deal that was already planned , routine , which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba .
&quot; it does not mean a rec@@ ess in President Chávez &apos;s health state , comm@@ ented . &quot;
the Chief Head of State participated today in L@@ ima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations Union ( Un@@ asu@@ r ) that concluded with so @-@ called regional integration to sustain progress , equality and security .
deaths for AIDS today are cause for detection .
F@@ abri@@ zio was 21 years old when he confirmed the outcome of the test : positive AIDS .
&quot; it was like I fell a bomb , &quot; referring to the mem@@ orial of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to do &quot; more whis@@ per , &quot; without any obvious success .
the boy hid him to his family .
he decided to take charge of his illness , and he began to report on her ; with that commitment that he already made his birthday 43 .
it is , of course , one of the oldest patients in the police hospital in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara .
F@@ abri@@ zio lives with the human immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ency virus ( HIV ) for 22 years , something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90 , when there were many doubts , few options for treatment and more stig@@ ma .
so , until the director of an IM@@ SS clin@@ ic prevented her from saying &quot; because he had a cut . &quot;
so , having AIDS was sy@@ non@@ y@@ mous with death .
it is now possible to survive this syn@@ drome and do so as life .
however , ignor@@ ant of their illness , many people are still arriving when the virus has already caused its ra@@ in@@ ches , &quot; exhausted &apos; its immun@@ e system and are victims of opportun@@ istic infec@@ tions .
to 31 years of the emergence of AIDS in the world , at least the first cases reported , &quot; the great achievement is at the moment that the survi@@ ving of a patient who starts treatment in the timely form and the over@@ life of the general population is exactly the same &apos; , &quot; he said the Bos@@ s of the H@@ C@@ G We@@ ll@@ anu@@ t , and that is exactly the same .
In@@ fec@@ olog@@ ist and an expert in HIV / AIDS , An@@ dra@@ de Vi@@ ll@@ anu@@ eva comm@@ ented that since 2008 , scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence , but the years of survi@@ v@@ ance and the quality of life depend on the extent of the immun@@ e of the immun@@ e system , with the best expectations of the immun@@ e system .
in simple words , it means that anyone who receives the HIV @-@ positive diagnosis to 25 years of age , under these terms &apos; while maintaining in control , can live without problems until 75 years &apos; , explained the inter@@ viewed .
in order to make this progress , we should remember that the life expectancy of the Mex@@ icans today is from 76 in average .
while mortality has fallen significantly over the last few years , in the case of Mexico , the number of people who die of AIDS fell from 6@@ .@@ 6@@ 78 cases in 2007 to 4.@@ 8@@ 62 in 2011 , it is also true that from the appearance of the AIDS , 60 % of the patients on the basis of national data have died .
only in J@@ alis@@ co 2@@ 55 people died in 2011 , and they are 18@@ 7 deaths until May this year ; nevertheless , there is universal access to anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al drugs from 2005 .
- Why are there still deaths ?
it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment .
that &apos;s how I saw it , so it has happened in our hospital .
at least in the last 12 years , we have not had the problem of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they are unaware of their state of infection , or , in any event , in the days of the disease .
it gave a strong amount : &apos; nine of every ten patients arrive when there are already some opportun@@ istic infection which has to be done in order to have a greater impact on global mortality , that is to do more early diagno@@ ses and therefore have to be tested in a massive way , to all those who require &apos; .
in its proposal , they coincide specialists and officials from the State of the Pre@@ vention of S@@ ida in J@@ alis@@ co , including the patients themselves , such as F@@ abri@@ zio , who came to the test to a particular laboratory , which is one of the common complic@@ ations , which is one of the common complic@@ ations .
everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
some think they &apos;re going to die and they don &apos;t want to know anything .
&quot; if I &apos;m already going to die , I can see three times to the week &apos; , say not in my case .
change was to improve , I &apos;m good , I do , I take the medicines .
at the date , your parents only know that he suffered cancer .
I live a normal life , like anyone .
&quot; work , I have many activities , I have an active sexual life , but it is up to me and the other person , &quot; listed F@@ abri@@ zio , who agreed to share his own life with the end of the World Day .
that the test will be made , if they had a risk , that they will soon be able to know whether they are HIV positive , it is better and if they already have the diagnosis , they learn that they can live as anyone , being responsible .
that , your message , sum@@ mar@@ ises the motto of the battle to AIDS this 2012 .
con@@ dom@@ s after the counter
large numbers are the le@@ aks between the health and the common public , con@@ quer@@ ed Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ azar , journalist who has taken the cause of HIV .
and the biggest is prevention .
in the places dedicated to this task , the allocation of con@@ dom@@ s has been increased before we were one or two , now they give us a hundred , and that is very well , but it is that there are those who are today , still , have no access to a con@@ dom , and that is still the case .
among the most vulnerable to new infec@@ tions are teen@@ ag@@ ers .
&quot; for what do you want ? &quot; it is a common question , with a hearing and the courage of social women , school guidance , pharm@@ acies of pharm@@ acies and health , to which the teen@@ ag@@ ers are not being exposed .
it proposed re@@ direc@@ ting this ineffective distribution ; that the con@@ dom@@ s are not only after the winners and those hundred people are in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ year @-@ old f@@ lame .
it is not motiv@@ ating the eleg@@ ant .
it is not about paying them the ch@@ ambers and the mot@@ el , as the Governor E@@ mili@@ o González said , to ask if he would have been able to preserve con@@ dom@@ s in their administration .
&quot; so it is not sexu@@ ality , the best is to bring the con@@ dom@@ s to those who already practise a sexual activity , &quot; marked .
key in J@@ alis@@ co
there are 13@@ .@@ 4@@ 35 accumul@@ ated cases ( 12@@ ,@@ 15@@ 8 AIDS and 1.@@ 3@@ 17 of HIV ) .
the state is 4 a national place in new and accumul@@ ated cases of AIDS and 13 of HIV .
92 % of the infec@@ tions is the sexual route , 6 % to the blood and 2 % road to the road .
it is estimated that 50 thousand people can be living with HIV because for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know .
ratified by an appeal court of the United States , a judgment which dis@@ covers the re@@ structure of the Vi@@ tro Group &apos;s debt achieved by a commercial contest in Mexico , the scene places a neg@@ li@@ te precedent for any national company with a view to solvency .
it would , therefore , be said that the procedures for the over@@ life of the signatures that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and the stars , against international conventions .
in the practical field , the reb@@ ate to the ruling issued on 15 June last night by the judge Har@@ lin H@@ ale of the ban@@ ner in the north @-@ in @-@ law of Texas , leaves the Mexican signatures against the possibility of the embargo on their proper@@ ties .
however , the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to come to the United States Supreme Court , claiming three inconsist@@ encies .
from the outset , while the judge of the cause points out that credi@@ tors must be governed by the United States &apos; Rights Act , the Court of Ap@@ mons of the Fifth C@@ ir@@ c@@ ito , with headquarters in New Or@@ leans , says that the main procedure is to be processed in Mexico .
the first point would be to dis@@ miss international processing cooperation in cases of in@@ solvency of companies with trans@@ national profile .
in fact , to that end , the United Nations Mo@@ de@@ lo Act was created for the unifor@@ mity of International Mer@@ can@@ commercial law , including the US Law .
secondly , the judgment states that without the inter@@ corporate vote , recognised in the critical mass of the mer@@ can@@ commercial contest the debts they had with their ma@@ tri@@ x of Vi@@ tro , would not have been able to have the required majority to approve the re@@ structure .
however , the possibility of recognising the Mexican laws .
in fact , Vi@@ tro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted .
there are half a dozen examples , including the Mexican and Mexican trade , whose inter@@ corpor@@ ated debts supported the Federal Institute of mer@@ chan@@ dise .
the truth , moreover , is that the votes of the subsidi@@ aries , in any case , the ad@@ minis@@ trat@@ ors of the Vi@@ tro who fought against this in the United States of America , is to say the &apos; Budd@@ h@@ ments &apos; funds as an Au@@ reli@@ os , Mr Elliot , Mr Elliot and Li@@ ver@@ pool Li@@ mi@@ pool .
the vote would have been 45 % against 37 .
the fact is that the Court of Ap@@ mons is om@@ itted .
from another angle , this is a matter for Vi@@ tro of the difficult situation faced by the year 2008 to sup@@ per the serious economic crisis faced by the United States , by beating the country .
as soon as possible , the signing of the González S@@ ada family will bring a re@@ consideration to the court itself in order to make the vote come to the full of this , namely the five magistr@@ ates , given that they voted only three .
if this is not to flou@@ rish , C@@ erci@@ or@@ will &apos;s appeal will require the review of the process by a higher authority , in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States .
the very serious thing of the case is that the court stopped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the form of am@@ ic@@ us curi@@ ae ( &quot; friend of the Court &apos; ) , in which the procedure followed by the framework of the Com@@ mer@@ cial Com@@ mer@@ cial Act , pointing out that this drow@@ ned to the agreements signed by the two countries in order to bring this to the conclusion of the United States Convention .
more still , it is pointed out that the country has made it to the principles of the United Nations Committee for International Trade , that is to say the fixed rules for cross @-@ border cases of in@@ solvency , which guarantee equity and credi@@ tors .

and it is that before a stroke of brain was confined to a whe@@ el@@ chair in 2008 , Re@@ yes was in the sport for more than 60 years , it was as a group of minor categories , the Bal@@ pical player , and the leader in the B@@ S@@ N with Bay@@ am@@ ón and President of the Bal@@ on@@ c@@ esto Federation .
&quot; I put a lot of h@@ ats in the bas@@ ket@@ ball through my life , including several to the same time , as when it was President of the B@@ S@@ N , the National E@@ qui@@ po General and Chairman of the Federal Minister for the 19@@ 90 &apos; , recalled Re@@ yes during a visit from the First H@@ ora to his home in Bay@@ am@@ ón , where he lies with Isab@@ el , his true wife .

&quot; those were my best years , the most I enjoyed because I had the opportunity to be part of eight champi@@ on@@ ates of the V@@ aqu@@ ers from 1967 , it was already as apo@@ lar@@ ed , or leader .
there were many years of satis@@ fications , including the five champi@@ on@@ ships running from 197@@ 1 to 1975 .
and then I &apos;ve had one in the 198@@ 1 , the year of Jer@@ ome M@@ inc@@ y in the B@@ S@@ N .

I remember that if M@@ inc@@ y had given him a champi@@ on@@ ship to Bay@@ am@@ on , G@@ aus@@ se would help to bring another one .
the V@@ aus@@ ers &apos; champi@@ on@@ ship with G@@ aus@@ se gave it to him , but the distance , because for 1988 , it was already a sign of the feder@@ ation .
for that time I preferred to enjoy its execu@@ tives and those of M@@ inc@@ y in the National In@@ tel@@ le .
I remember when we first earned the United States during the Olympic Pre@@ Olympic in Mexico 1989 .
then the World Cup came from 1990 , where we got room for a quarter , and it must have been br@@ ank of not being by the Canadian Arctic who made us repeat the final play for second time , Re@@ yes .
that World Cup of 1990 is the best National E@@ qui@@ po you have seen ?
it is among the best , just like the one who won the Dre@@ am Te@@ am in the 2004 O@@ cleaned .
but my favorite was the one of the Americans in Cuba in 1991 , when we win gold and we gave it to the United States team , which was quite similar to the fact that we won the br@@ ank in the world .
that team is not only repeating M@@ inc@@ y , G@@ aus@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ vas , F@@ ico López and &quot; P@@ icul@@ in , &quot; but also had ( Javier ) &quot; To@@ ñ@@ ito , &quot; but also had ( Javier ) &quot; To@@ ñ@@ ito , &quot; but also had to go to the Le@@ on .
a team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff , but it gave us a gold med@@ al and a great joy was that of the 1995 Olympic Pre@@ ul in Ne@@ u@@ qu@@ én , Argentina .
with rol players such as &apos; C@@ ani@@ to &apos; Ni@@ eves , Pablo A@@ lic@@ ea and a youth Rol@@ ando H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ in@@ er in substitu@@ tion of the players suspended by the Gulf of the North American Sea , we earn gold against all the forecasts .
what was the best player in Pu@@ erto R@@ ico ?
certainly , that was P@@ icul@@ z Or@@ ti@@ z .
their numbers at international tower are impressive .
nobody in Pu@@ erto R@@ ico has dominated that level as P@@ icul@@ in did .
and that without your record in the different light that played .
who was the best leader Bor@@ cast@@ a ?
that is very difficult .
we have had a very good walk that includes Ju@@ lio T@@ oro , F@@ lor Mel@@ éndez , Carlos Mor@@ ales , Raymond Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ man@@ t Torres .
from young people , I really like Leo Ari@@ ll &apos;s work .
what do you consider your greatest achievement in the feder@@ ation ?
having been part of the most glori@@ ous era of the National E@@ qui@@ po between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of 90 the B@@ S@@ N had until 17 teams in a season .
what did he get to do ?
there were things that would have wanted to implement , as the region@@ alisation of minor categories .
for example , the boys of P@@ 11 only play in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island in national be@@ aches .
right now , children travel and play too much .
at least I see the fruit of the regular@@ al and ongoing certificates for leaders , table officers and Arctic .
I am pleased .
what are you doing now ?
all I do is listen to music , see music from the music of my time in Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , I enjoy my grand@@ children and time to go to bas@@ ket@@ ball games .
and of course , enjoy my wife &apos;s company , Isab@@ el , who has always been with me .
he dies , Larry H@@ ag@@ man .
Larry H@@ ag@@ man , born on 21 September 19@@ 31 , in For@@ th Wor@@ th ( Texas ) , became glob@@ ally famous for its central role as John Ross E@@ wing , more known as &quot; J.@@ R . &quot;
Larry H@@ ag@@ man , whose role as the oil pred@@ ator J.@@ R. E@@ wing E@@ wing in the television series of &apos; Dal@@ las &apos; became a symbol of the gre@@ ed in the 1980s , has died .
I had 81 years .
H@@ ag@@ man , who returned this year as J.@@ R. in a new season of &quot; Dal@@ las , &quot; died on Friday afternoon due to complic@@ ations of cancer , according to a given family release to The Pres@@ s Pres@@ s .
&quot; Larry was back in his dear home city of Dal@@ las , representing again the tri@@ onic role he liked , &quot; he said the family .
Larry &apos;s family and his closest friends were with him in Dal@@ las for Th@@ ank@@ s@@ age Day .
nice Gr@@ ay , who interpreted the role of his wife in the original number and in the sequ@@ el , he was with H@@ ag@@ man when he died in a hospital of Dal@@ las , he said the advertising of her , Jef@@ frey Lane .
I was pleased with all that I knew .
it was creative , generous , fun , funny , sweet and tal@@ ented , and I &apos;ll miss it very much .
&quot; it was an original person and lived life at the highest , &quot; he said Gr@@ ay in a commun@@ i@@ qué .
H@@ ag@@ man diagno@@ sed h@@ ep@@ atic bel@@ ls in 1992 and recognised that he had been drinking much for years .
in 1995 , a m@@ align@@ ant tum@@ or was found in the liver and was put to a trans@@ plant .
years before &quot; Dal@@ las , H@@ ag@@ man was famous in television as a decent guy in the light of &quot; I Dre@@ am of Je@@ an@@ nie Je@@ an@@ nie , &quot; spread by the N@@ BC chain of 19@@ 65 to 1970 .
he interpreted the captain Tony Nelson , an astron@@ au@@ t whose life is being altered when he finds an attractive genius , interpreted by Barbara E@@ den , and it takes her to live with him .
it was also a two @-@ sided player that was little time to the air , &quot; The Good Life &apos; ( N@@ BC , 197@@ 1 @-@ 72 ) and &quot; Pac@@ ingo van Ag@@ ain &apos; .
his work in the cinema included well @-@ received papers from the criticism in &apos; The Alliance , &quot; Harry and T@@ onto Col@@ ors and &quot; Pri@@ quet Col@@ ors . &quot;
but it was his magistr@@ ate interpretation of the loving Lady J.@@ R. the one who took H@@ ag@@ man to his maximum cr@@ at .
the dramatic number of the C@@ B@@ S chain on E@@ wing and other charac@@ ters in their or@@ bit was in April 197@@ 8 to May 1991 .
the phrase promoted by J.@@ R. J@@ R. , which is intended to generate expectations around a full episode of emotions in which H@@ ag@@ man &apos;s character is almost killed , created international speculation and millions of dollars .
he also helped to give him a record record at that time .
when it was revealed the answer in a chapter in November 1980 , an average of 41 million tel@@ les , and turned into &apos; Dal@@ las &apos; in the second enter@@ tainment programme of the history , behind the end of the &apos; MA@@ S@@ H &apos; in 198@@ 3 , which had 50 million view@@ ers .
it was J.@@ R. &apos;s sister , Kri@@ sti@@ n ( interpreted by Mary Cro@@ s@@ by ) who shot him .
J.@@ R. the embarrassing and then threatened her with a ho@@ ok@@ er of prostitu@@ te unless he left the city , but others also had reason to attack it .
H@@ ag@@ man interpreted E@@ wing as an un@@ holy corrupt with a char@@ is@@ matic smile : an entrepreneur and an un@@ holy husband who tried to see his alcoholic wife , Sue Ellen ( Linda Gr@@ ay ) .
&quot; I know what I want in the name of J.@@ R &apos; .
I should say : &quot; here lies the honest citizen J.@@ R. E@@ wing . &quot;
this is the only negoti@@ ator that he lost .
vic@@ tor victory , the original number of the original number , remembered Friday to H@@ ag@@ man as a &quot; huge , inside and outside the screen . &quot;
it is in@@ dispu@@ table , and ir@@ re@@ plac@@ eable , for millions of fans in the world , and in the hearts of each of us , that we were lucky to meet him and love him .
ten episo@@ des of the new edi@@ tion of &quot; Dal@@ las &quot; were passed a few months ago with great success for the T@@ N@@ T channel .
the five @-@ year record was over for the second season and a sixth was in the process , reported the chain .
there was immediately no statement of War@@ ner or T@@ N@@ T on how to handle the loss of H@@ ag@@ man .
I want For@@ t Wor@@ th , Texas , it was a son of the ac@@ tress and singer Mary Martin , who became classi@@ cal works like &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter P@@ an . &quot;
Martin was still a teen@@ ager when he had it in 19@@ 31 during his marriage with Ben H@@ ag@@ man .
he was lucky in New York the@@ ories at the beginning of the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , and then served in the 19@@ 52 Air Force to 1956 in England .
as long as he was there , he met the young Swedish desig@@ ner to admit A@@ x@@ el@@ sson and married her .
the couple had two children , P@@ rest@@ on and Hei@@ di , and lived for long in the city of M@@ ali@@ bu in M@@ ali@@ bu , where many cel@@ eb@@ arities lie .
in 2001 , he called for his memories &quot; Hello Dar@@ lin &apos; : T@@ all ( and Ab@@ solu@@ tely Tru@@ e ) T@@ ales on my Life .
&quot; I didn &apos;t put anything there that I believe was to hurt someone or affect them somehow , &quot; he said to P@@ ren@@ sa A@@ soci@@ ada in that time .
after the trans@@ plant trans@@ plant became a promot@@ er of organ donation and working as a volunte@@ er in a hospital to attend the sick patients .
&quot; I would advise them , I give them courage , not with them when they come for their surgery , and then , &quot; indicated in 1996 .
I &apos;m trying to offer some comfort , as &quot; do not fear , it will be a little awkward for a short time , but they will be fine . &quot;
it was also an activi@@ st against smoking and took part in a number of campaigns .
they start running the &quot; F@@ in of the world &quot;
every week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ tic subjects such as nuclear war , zom@@ bies , vir@@ uses and g@@ ags , and global warming .
this sem@@ ester , when Professor Stuart Ch@@ arm@@ é decided , decided to take a course on the end of the world , I knew that he was with an ir@@ resis@@ tible f@@ uss : the end of the &apos; long account &apos; of the Cal@@ end@@ ary , on 21 December , which has been held in the end of the world .
but , Ch@@ arm@@ é , I had no idea what I expected in the next couple of months : the hur@@ ric@@ ic hur@@ ric@@ ic Sandy , a tax pi@@ geon that some have called &apos; de@@ ud@@ ag@@ ag@@ ed@@ on &apos; and an increasing conflict involving Israel , the place where the Christians in the end of the time believe that the Apo@@ cal@@ y@@ sis will be initiated .
&quot; I didn &apos;t realize that this was going to be the most apo@@ cal@@ tic sem@@ ester , &quot; said Ch@@ arm@@ é this week to students from Ru@@ t@@ gers @-@ Cam@@ den University ( New Jersey ) .
if you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
and remember that it is good for those of apo@@ cal@@ tic mentality .
and he is not a single teacher who offers courses on the &apos; end of the world &apos; , in theory the last of history .
in T@@ emp@@ le , Professor Barry V@@ ack@@ er is taking the course of the street , Culture and the end of the world . &quot;
every week , students explore apo@@ cal@@ tic subjects such as nuclear war , zom@@ bies , vir@@ uses and g@@ ags , and global warming .
&quot; we look at why these ideas are in the process of time , &quot; he said , and the way in which they offer hypo@@ the@@ tical scenarios that have some human behaviour .
if nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists , for example , there could be a war .
this month students analysed films with apo@@ cal@@ tic subjects and expl@@ ored how they share with examples of real life .
&quot; I tried to inform students about what is possible , likely , credible and impossible , &quot; said V@@ ack@@ er .
in the main campus of the National Pen@@ n@@ lv@@ ania University , the Croatian Hist@@ ory professor Matthew R@@ est@@ all and his colleague A@@ unt Sol@@ ari , an ad@@ journ@@ al teacher of the Ar@@ te and An@@ tro@@ po@@ logy , have made a team for the end of the world .
&quot; we do not add &apos; 2012 &apos; to always have the choice of the course of the course , if the world is not over , said R@@ est@@ all .
despite the &apos; imminent ru@@ ine &apos; , students must study , generate projects and take final tests .
in Pen@@ n State , the final examination will be taken on the eve of the Apo@@ cal@@ p@@ sis , which leaves the students another option more than to work at the same night when the world is supposed to end , said R@@ est@@ all .
the courses were quite popular .
&quot; it fell in two hours &apos; , he said R@@ est@@ all on his course for students with high average , which was filled with 35 students .
we received messages by e @-@ mail for weeks and weeks before the start of the sem@@ ester , people who asked whether there was still room .
students , for their part , make sure that the course is one of the most interesting .
&quot; it is fascinating to see what people do to con@@ sol@@ ate themselves , &quot; he said Brid@@ gi@@ d Rob@@ inson , a career student in Re@@ li@@ gi@@ on and Social Democrat of 23 years of H@@ ad@@ don@@ field , New Jersey , in Ru@@ t@@ gers @-@ Cam@@ den .
and it is that the apo@@ cal@@ tic , secular or religious mentality is only a question of comfort or the absence of it .
will We@@ k@@ esa , a career student and En@@ fer@@ mer@@ y , of 25 years , said to have seen all the apo@@ cal@@ tic films .
&quot; I never heard about a class that could teach that , &quot; indicated .
I enjoy it .
but no student inter@@ viewed - and much less a teacher - said on the date of the age of 21 December .
&quot; our first project was about the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y and a certain way we dis@@ credi@@ ted it , &quot; he said Julie Z@@ eg@@ len , a last year in T@@ emp@@ le , 21 and West Ch@@ ester .
the may@@ es never predicted the end of the world ; it is just a key point in the timetable , he said R@@ est@@ all .
but he was assuming that there is an anxiety in Western culture , which dates back to several centuries , where people react to the changes to their pre@@ acher around the world .
the Internet has caused a boom of these specul@@ ations .
&quot; on other sides , people do not think about this , &quot; he said .
mostly in the English world of speaking .
Joseph D@@ ough@@ er@@ ty , a teacher of religion from the University of La Sal@@ le , which has been in@@ part in the Philipp@@ ines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any course of the end of the world .
&quot; the Philipp@@ ines do not participate in the end of the world , &quot; wrote , insinu@@ ating an exception of a superior authority .
we have a pardon from the Pope .
R@@ est@@ all made it clear that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final trial , and he said that , if there is nothing on 21 December , the people will begin to think immediately in the next &apos; or to philosoph@@ ical that 21 December is the beginning of a seven @-@ year period .
students and teachers are taking the date li@@ ghtly .
a number of people said they intend to go to parties &quot; in the end of the world . &quot;
&quot; maybe I call some friends to get us together , &quot; comm@@ ented on Sam@@ ira Ford , 20 @-@ year communications student .
it is part of the human nature taking place in hy@@ lar .
I &apos;ll go back to bed ...
blue .
Hello , Miss .
but it is compulsory to eat pol@@ enta .
please , Cher@@ yl , don &apos;t protest .
Yeah .
that &apos;s the point .
what kind of children are these guys who can play with this very effective toy ?
you &apos;d let me die on the road . &quot; it &apos;s too bad . &quot;
Ma@@ xi@@ mili@@ an , Ma@@ xi@@ mili@@ an .
you &apos;re all right .
it was worth police persecution , so that we can handle this bi@@ bike by Ar@@ ling@@ ton Hill .
give me the hand .
it &apos;s funny .
can I help you ?
just get the block@@ age .
huh ?
I was terri@@ fied that we had to play a real role .
- Yeah .
I have to finish this .
Yeah .
welcome !
and you &apos;re an ugly cop .
- Yeah .
we &apos;re not going to work with F@@ inch .
trust me .
take a good day , sir .
- I &apos;m telling you the truth .
ma &apos;am .
as I said before , your brother stole three of my girls .
because he put a waste plant together with a recre@@ ational area .
what the hell ?
but it is not .
I don &apos;t care about the benefit , with all respect .
where is he ?
- With the airport .
he was referring to the fourth room , which is not exactly the basement , but the &apos; sem@@ ane &apos; , as we called it to dig@@ ul@@ ate .
the leader of the issuing , Carl Bo@@ en@@ ish with Dave B@@ lat@@ tell .
- Then find out who is .
looks like you &apos;re getting crazy .
what ?
there you go .
&quot; they fear it openly . &quot;
- What did you detect ?
and it &apos;s good for me .
don &apos;t be an idiot .
I would like to know what you think of this , Mr H@@ ora .
- Is it him ?
I &apos;m just going to put the waste down .
in fact , recently in E@@ bay someone won one , I believe that without a box around 150 hundred .
it &apos;s weird , my grandmother said that the tel@@ s were little , they were in a house .
it &apos;s amazing .
Mr. C@@ ain@@ --
my husband died in a training accident ?
come on .
- If you have been rus@@ hed !
if Em@@ met ... if J@@ ah@@ el says something else , you call me radio .
well , you can &apos;t .
Mi@@ key .
so , aren &apos;t you really a psy@@ ch@@ ic ?
I &apos;m not stupid .
Prime Minister !
Eva , be unstable .
and if the heat is still too much ... there is always a frozen shower .
hit me , monster !
- What are you thinking ?
what happened ?
Oh ...
what ?
somebody turn off the chain !
- He &apos;s saying
great winner .
- Good for you and ...
that &apos;s it .
Bla@@ de crossed genetic changes to the born .
do you understand me ?
thank you for everything , Mrs Foster .
what do you expect ?
my grandmother .
this is , uh , apartment on the side of which we were right .
just knowing in your hearts .
if the angel starts with him , he will be great .
and while the room is empty
no , I just enjoy seeing you confirm your hetero@@ sexu@@ ality .
probably ... a game which starts by &quot; Ma . &quot;
T@@ ac@@ had that idea .
it &apos;s what brought us here .
- No mention of the 400 hectares , the cro@@ wn camp and the breeding house .
Larry Brown .
you &apos;ve always been a cop . you &apos;re just a secret now !
- Really ?
in 20 minutes .
that &apos;s not the case .
no , I can &apos;t .
we really didn &apos;t take it right at the beginning , right ?
in a cold night of October , a small village in Col@@ orado was faced with New Jersey and finally said , &quot;
it was an unexpected pregnancy .
look , I &apos;m touching you , see ?
you too .
fuck !
the world changes .
I am here , right outside the house of the high local lawyer Roy K@@ ess@@ ler , who has just joined me , and has a pretty shocking announcement to give .
I didn &apos;t think it was so late .
Mr Ol@@ br@@ y@@ h@@ ski ( Poland ) , Ku@@ z@@ lava :
- It &apos;s called M@@ elo@@ dy .
excuse me .
&quot; Mis@@ ha always liked me more , but I was afraid of your silence .
and Abby told Lisa , &quot; You should read better books &quot;
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re expanding hori@@ z@@ ons .
don &apos;t worry Martin .
why are you concerned ?
this calm down the ner@@ ves .
- You remember ?
it must have been because he liked to be surrounded by young people .
I &apos;ll be compensated .
but , J@@ oy , if that is what you want , why not ?
all the lot@@ te is around a million pounds .
bring it back , please .
- T@@ us words .
why are you here ?
okay , I see Doc .
it was so ru@@ sty that I doubt it can disappear .
O@@ key , Dar@@ n@@ ell , these painting painting a tur@@ tle right now , and I &apos;m not asking for legal advice to you or any other pa@@ inter of tur@@ tle .
isn &apos;t it the ch@@ ac@@ ras area ?
I know I have to get to the day , but I understand that time is short .
I have 20 points .
it &apos;s totally useless at this stage !
between the shock treatments .
it &apos;s my friend Charlie , I think I have already mentioned it .
- And why are your men unemployed ?
he &apos;s got the washing rocks .
the body &apos;s body ?
it &apos;s your decision .
- Of course .
get out of here .
you know , I don &apos;t even know why I took this programme .
who is the king ?
- Sir Philip ...
&quot; by expressing your name . &quot;
how did Jen say to you ?
it would not be the first time you pretend something .
- I couldn &apos;t sign it .
- Get out !
especially now that I need you with the book .
nothing .
those suspects had no daughter who was raped and whose face was re@@ tr@@ ayed .
leave me alone .
Doug said he met with you on 15 November .
didn &apos;t I say any surprises ?
- Will .
he sends him to his little dear cri@@ es a bottle of oc@@ eans of kis@@ ses
and his he@@ els , such as sab@@ u@@ ese , hunger , the sword and the fire were fl@@ ouri@@ shing to be employees .
I &apos;m going to prepare coffee .
you know , it &apos;s better to pick them up so that they don &apos;t break .
what the fuck are you looking at ?
&quot; no hurry &quot;
- Cr@@ ash her !
not now .
- Ray .
let &apos;s see that horse running and win !
what &apos;s going on ?
I didn &apos;t want to scare you .
we &apos;re not going anywhere until we get our money .
- That was your ch@@ ol@@ era .
Hi .
what about you guys ?
I &apos;m just a person who helps people , sir .
Hello love .
why was the victim here in the middle of night ?
secure the hug !
I checked it yesterday and everything was fine
Jesus .
keep going , that &apos;s not with us .
all you can give here is a reservation .
thir@@ sty .
but being soci@@ al requires much longer , long hours of work .
it &apos;s the pleasure without excellence .
I will take the consequences .
but how am I supposed to be good with a lun@@ atic front ?
as far as the world is concerned , you are dead in a prison , or in a car@@ t .
wh@@ ites of nature .
it wasn &apos;t necessary .
without sex or things .
when it comes to the med@@ uses , it &apos;s a but@@ ter@@ fly fish .
where have you been all my life ?
call me Brad .
- Sh@@ ould I be orange color ?
I &apos;ll wait for the income .
- Are you okay ?
Hey , Dad No@@ el , it &apos;s 2 : 00 .
a week later , I went back to work ... and the same thing happened .
I know .
did you know , and yet you left ?
could it have been taken by someone to act only ... taking it to shoulder , for example ?
- Qui@@ et , identify !
- Z@@ amb@@ ul@@ le@@ te .
luc@@ ki@@ ly , the jury would think that it was too good ... and I would start to sympath@@ ise with the weakest ... without even knowing .
Wow .
I &apos;m here .

P@@ op@@ g@@ ale against a tree so that your s@@ ail@@ ors don &apos;t get out .

a lot of people are living in TV , in re@@ emission and cable broadcast@@ ers , if we add all of what they have seen in television , in the re@@ organisation and in the cable chains ... over half of the country has seen G@@ u A@@ e Je@@ ong .

I &apos;m ready .
I think I &apos;ve left something in the library .

- Yeah .
the police in the police managed to highlight the audio to be able to discer@@ n something of what Tit@@ us said .
if you break it , all we have built here will disappear .

it is easy to disappear a person in a crowd without a lot of attention .
the pig asked me to ask you whether this is from you .
then you know about babies , because you &apos;re gonna have yours .
that depends on you .
and your answer is &quot; I was walking &quot;

this is a simple City @-@ Z@@ .
- Take it .
Nick .
so the question is , how can we get to your side ?
I can &apos;t watch my back and yours .
dear , even with the mirac@@ les of plastic surgery you will not be so sexy for a long time .
Shi@@ i Ann ?
what should be expected , if ?
maybe you weren &apos;t the son you believed to be .
okay .
what do you want me to do with this information ?
he lives alone in what is practically a castle .
a gol@@ ce then ?
and I saw her writing a letter and putting the gift under the tree .
let &apos;s get to Fant@@ waves , just get out of Lord &apos;s castle .
unless you really believe that you would reopen your case , and you will not believe it until you get that bastard from Rus@@ sel N@@ ash .
- You didn &apos;t find anything ?
he &apos;s not doing any harm .
but unless there &apos;s anything I &apos;m not seeing ,
Hello ?
I figured I &apos;d find you here .
I hope everyone will take this opportunity .
all you spent on that thing ... do you know how many seats we could have bought ?
you can &apos;t imagine what it meant for me that package .
- It is impossible .
nobody forced her .
he started behind the scene , but now he &apos;s making more public appear@@ ances .
he showed me the lab@@ inet of cour@@ tes@@ an life .
- What ?
you &apos;re ready .
huh ?
don &apos;t try to fool me .
it &apos;s you .
Hey So@@ okie , So@@ okie ... where is So@@ okie ?

- 3 to 2 to him .
Jesus Christ .
what does that make you then ?
I &apos;ll be right away .
no .
- Don &apos;t worry .
that &apos;s why nobody wants work .
I had a life .
there will be a new edi@@ tion next week in the television .
I didn &apos;t know where they took him .
as soon as we do , I &apos;ll get my life back .
- All right .

funny music ?
he &apos;s here !
- It &apos;s not gu@@ essing .
take off .
no , I &apos;ve been in that place before
now the car was no longer terribly unstable , but it would stabili@@ se 2@@ 10 mp@@ h .
come on , we &apos;re right behind them .
I challenge you to deny it .
anything you have dre@@ amed for Con@@ dor@@ man , you have to draw the plans and we will do the rest .
Oh , yeah .
take a seat .
but I didn &apos;t have time and I did my job .
I just want to take your hand .
let &apos;s do that .
- It &apos;s me .
does it not seem suspicious ?
the case is that this week was div@@ ine .
Oh , damn it .

see you &apos;re working .
have you seen her statement ?
Hy@@ de , that &apos;s awful .
- We have formed a medical committee .
I &apos;m gonna call her to eat .
Ar@@ j@@ un Sing@@ h is always there !
no , everything that unit@@ es them was a description .
- Don &apos;t worry .
well , those Japanese who have just seen each other .
he &apos;s upstairs .
Yeah , some guys read signals some guys have letters , but I have this .
my H@@ o !
- inflexible .
I have talent , intelligence , courage !
you can be very proud of him .
it &apos;s still in the search , if it really is Mr Volk@@ off ...
and everything , even more insignificant , had another taste , knowing that it was for her last time .
I &apos;m really sorry , Mar@@ it@@ za .
I can &apos;t lose this call .
Hi .
thank you very much .
I &apos;ll go back and talk , okay ?
maybe an innocent child would not have been murdered .
as I had started to explain , I address a group called the re@@ location and Education Initiative for Ho@@ gar , or I@@ RE@@ H .
Hey , Roc@@ ky .
here .
I haven &apos;t even been able to take his hand , damn it .
you take the wind , and you &apos;re on the street .
have you read my script ?
it &apos;s impossible to get Da Costa .
that phone , take it with you all the time .
now come on !
I know .
well , I guess everything happens for a reason , Randy .
we have the test .
see you at lunch ?
that stupid machine ?
parking .
okay .
come back with my money ... or I swear I &apos;ll kill you !
I &apos;m sorry .

he was dead .
- I &apos;ll raise them .
no , Frank .
I got caught , guys .
by coming up .
good night .
let &apos;s start there .
if she was with a prostitu@@ te ?
what happened to C@@ in@@ na ?
I got confused .
&quot; the king and the Queen and the queen . &quot;
on the other hand , we must keep Charles and Henry Col@@ ling@@ rid@@ ge at the point of view , if possible .
we used to go &quot; one of the time back home in Lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana when I was a child .
well , I suggest that one side , sir .
I was rus@@ hed , then I told you to the taxi that go through the park .
we need to go .
the Er@@ ica Si@@ kes programme , TV .
to pick up the potential survi@@ v@@ ors .
but he has always loved youth .
I can &apos;t breathe !
but you have no obligation .
- Don &apos;t move ...
he &apos;s destroying a witness , giving them everything he has .
you must remain hidden .
that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been talking about in months .
but how will you get to the man@@ sion ?
I had everything in that suit@@ case .
okay , no , no , no . okay ?
Hello ?
- You &apos;re sick .
- I &apos;ll get the car .
we could be big .
you talk like a man ...
St@@ on@@ ec@@ l@@ ough fell apart as he was grown up , passing through the middle @-@ age of the age .
however , we can .
for that stu@@ pi@@ dity !
who attacked the priest ?
I &apos;m sorry , sir .
you ... past ... trau@@ matic experience .
you hit as a girl .
&quot; I &apos;m going to all your con@@ s , but it is impossible to talk to you .
the rest can go .
and that was the first time in my life ... that I saw someone representing what is feeling ... or I guess it is not what feels ... that it feels like it is in this , as when I &apos;m dating .
pigs are trained to kill .
first I have to go .
- Thank you .
they wanted us to kill each other .
he &apos;s got a boyfriend , remember ?
Johnny took us trust , Miss Red@@ man@@ .
my heart is yours , it has always been .
un@@ conscious , definitely .
now you want to change and start leaving me .
now I &apos;m going to take the t@@ ami .
I know I &apos;m not too smart .
I &apos;ll be better on the way out of here .
I &apos;ll be right back .
- Thank you .
Mas@@ ami !
- I don &apos;t know .
if you want me to take you home , you can .
I have just had a vision .
you know , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s fun , because they &apos;re not at all like I remembered .
no , I don &apos;t want anything !
- Cri@@ se ?
R@@ ah@@ way , signature of auto@@ graphs .
if you knew dear sir ...
what happened ?
well , bra@@ vo .

it &apos;s all for you .
you &apos;re gonna give any gu@@ ts .
how &apos;s your name ?
- You were crus@@ hing my face .
I love you .
well , you know how we guys are .
he doesn &apos;t want to see anyone , and the doctor says it &apos;s better not to take the opposite .
it &apos;s not the same .
so you admit that you have a problem .
we need G@@ ill@@ er alive .
Hello ?
will it not be by any chance Vir@@ gi@@ l Mer@@ ri@@ weather ?

Kate .
Mr Bob@@ r@@ uc@@ z ?
give me a ser@@ geant of the drinks !
you sound really beautiful today .
I was looking for me
what you need .
maybe it will be the guest of the M@@ eg@@ atro@@ n War ship .
I remember it was a pretty serious court and some points were given .
okay , all right , man !
we &apos;ll go , but not empty hands .
it had easy , one day in the cross , a weekend in hell , and all the ang@@ els of the ang@@ els for etern@@ ity .
well , this is the last game of the normal season .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re mature with all this .
I didn &apos;t want to work !
the kind of things and the way they are .
what way ?
in 18@@ 84 , in a world conference it was decided that the Mer@@ idi@@ an L@@ ine that is going through the Green@@ wich Observ@@ atory was going to be the original Mer@@ idi@@ an , the ma@@ ster@@ piece of Earth .
come on .
you know , someone professional .
it &apos;s amazing .
pain of throat , I have nau@@ sea .
we call for 5 million for pain , suffering , loss of income income .
I was thinking that maybe we took a hotel room tomorrow evening , to get out of the apartment .
I don &apos;t know .
I know what I did .
- Mor@@ e it .
we have been in transit from Earth to Hom@@ er@@ ead II .
I haven &apos;t seen it ... since day yesterday .
you can get out .
- Okay ...
really ?
the respir@@ ant .
I &apos;m happy to pay for the bottle , but first you have to wake up .
we have often heard Sam@@ ir talk to him .
- Thi@@ r@@ ty me@@ ters .
huh ?
you &apos;re looking at the glass .
wait for me !
- No ...
you &apos;re Z@@ ed .
Ger@@ ma@@ ine knows nothing about me .
are you going to raise your offer ?
please don &apos;t do this .
give me a hug .
I saw someone after these rocks .
look at the patient and point out your diagnosis in detail .
it makes me dirty .
Lily , why do you think that Par@@ ran@@ an girls have to scre@@ am when they win a game playing game ?
- No .
we &apos;re not going to wait in this line .
we &apos;ll see everything here .
I want to see what I lost three years ago .
can you sell toy trains ?
breathe .
- The other four are there .
you don &apos;t serve Santa !
I know I did wrong , I don &apos;t know why you didn &apos;t kill me .
it &apos;s guys against girls because it &apos;s very equal .
I need the help of one of your leaders .
excuse me .
Yeah , here I am .
technically , I can only turn it to you to save your life , but because that is probably never going to happen , I bring whisky .
run , Josh .
it could be a wonderful thing to work with .
I am Ian Pe@@ ek , and that is all in this edi@@ tion of &quot; The Pro@@ fun@@ do &quot; .
no , I can &apos;t .
that is not an answer .
well , Colonel Mon@@ c@@ out@@ ant will send a group of hom@@ ers - who will take the Mu@@ z@@ ill@@ ac bridge here .
we are receiving a negative feeling of the workers in the land .
love without conditions .
- They &apos;re the f@@ eds !
we can use the rest of the material to make a mo@@ ck@@ er to the stat@@ ue of freedom .
okay .
- He has done so .
if you &apos;d hurt yourself , then ?
so I will quit , if you want that .
there have been many delays , and fans are un@@ bear@@ able .
I &apos;m not co@@ ward . I &apos;m not !
run your hands and dol@@ ls and distribute the so@@ ap .
- S@@ ino , you &apos;re a dead man .
thank you .
you call him a risk ?
who is it ?
go back to play .
Mr Pu@@ jo@@ l , what do you think of this evening ?
you &apos;re looking for someone .
too close , it &apos;s crazy !
- Al@@ cal@@ de Edward B@@ ader .
can &apos;t we tell parents the baby sex ?
the di@@ ve , cor@@ ners , ex@@ otic fish ...
well , we can &apos;t just fall there ...
I want you to see if you can guess what the low cal@@ ories are .
Moun@@ tain Vi@@ e@@ w , eight units .
- What ?
Ed@@ dy , drop the gun !
there you go .
even deeper underground , but ... B &apos;@@ E@@ lan@@ na , look at this way .
I accepted his slow use and I made my best effort to follow it , and that did the difference .
on your way , and my girls will be released from this curse .
working in the K@@ ess@@ man building .
- Come on , Ch@@ ento , what do you expect ?
I want to know how long we will keep the distances with the boss .
all you have to do is accept .
no .
the honourable Member ... I want to tell you that he addressed a fair hearing ...
it was outside .
I think you should go back to H@@ awa@@ ï .
okay .
in TV , I always had the time with the staff .
B@@ on !
all right , we have four signs of life in two different locations .
- But it was what he told you , not listen to anything .
it &apos;s useless .
the party is called R@@ specul@@ t .
- Did I explain ?
stop !
I love you .
how long has he been mar@@ sh@@ al , Mr. Co@@ g@@ burn ?
- You do not take it very well when you are not accepted by a college with four gram@@ ati@@ al errors in the letter of rejection .
don &apos;t bother .
it &apos;ll take a week to fix the lead .
so that he does not send back on the poor workers .
in@@ tim@@ ate .
- Not his daughter ?
if you don &apos;t succeed , it will be for your fault .
what is that ?
nothing can land .
the transl@@ ator that rob@@ bed K@@ raz@@ n@@ ys , N@@ ak@@ lo@@ z , will be sold again to the best post .
and today , I &apos;m telling you your meaning .
&quot; rebels &quot;
the Jar@@ pper !
we got into a fight .
star star to 5 minutes .
- I killed ...
what happened today ?
I hate it .
without a total perception , of course , but still ...
Tom , report .
- What &apos;s wrong ?
get it !
look .
Hello . are you leaving ?
not again .
you were wonderful , honey .
I think the touch is outside my scope .
then you start thinking ... what is this all about ?
people are very superficial !
I &apos;ll stay here .
it makes the idea of bombing other people almost as an al@@ tru@@ istic act , or good .
now , that does not put the gun in the hands of Bow@@ ers , but that is almost definitive .
a story of love can happen in such a romantic journey .
Yeah , but I &apos;ll see Jesus .
or do you want me to leave it ?
calm down .
he chose his college on my client .
I &apos;m not looking for a choice , but a cafe@@ teria ?
- No , no .
Oh ...
it &apos;s going to happen .
I &apos;m enjoying it .
he just called and asked the cake .
the Mar@@ u has activ@@ ated the F@@ MS .
well , this isn &apos;t .
I understand it &apos;s fun when your face hit the door .
you &apos;re bleeding .
if there were only copyright rights in the first place , which is now a counter@@ balance .
we are partners .
you looked for the iron in the mail , you took the pictures ...
downstairs .
I &apos;ve been busy with the farm , preparing for auc@@ tion .
jump .
ri@@ bs ?
the chem@@ o is not working .
A@@ va , if you have a problem with Nancy , then I have a problem with Nancy .
D@@ ante was part of Little S@@ id .
- Look at how hard it is .
everything else .
well , it &apos;s not exactly a party , but the food I &apos;ve tried must be waiting for the dra@@ wer .
please don &apos;t start now .
you didn &apos;t wake me .
because unlike your boss , the spec@@ tac@@ le ratio is not one to one .
it &apos;s true .
why do I feel that I &apos;m not telling you that I kept it alive ?
tell us where it is .
that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s a weird guy .
that &apos;s because there &apos;s no guide .
the majority of the liquid seems to be joking here and there .
remember , Lady Clar@@ ke is sick and suffering .
you were ?
how important is the painting for you , Dean ?
H@@ al , over here .
you beat it well .
general was able to secure a concession .
and this must be Sab@@ r@@ ina .

this operation was a black sheep .
there are ap@@ ples , but it origin@@ ated in Moscow , Russia .

I know I never knew who my father is ... or was ... between all the men who could have been .
- Who spend time ?
when I &apos;m ready .
like me , here is with that book and that ridiculous letter .
why did I end up in a guy like him ?
I &apos;m not afraid , I can do anything .
- That was just an illusion .
they feel what we do to tyr@@ anny , and they want to join our cause .
dad !
so ?
E@@ mili@@ o left to L.A. and joined a street band in extor@@ tion .
I left it .
Yes !
you see .
- Bye , pu@@ ppy !
don &apos;t you mean anything ?
- But do you understand what they say ?
why can &apos;t you see who &apos; I am &apos; ?
he made me realize that I can &apos;t remember why I was ordered .
there &apos;s nothing you &apos;re going through , no mistake that you can make , which I didn &apos;t have happened to me before .
so ... then tell me , how am I supposed to do so ?
you see , that &apos;s exactly why I want to hold up .
let me go !
I wanted to talk about a fi@@ de@@ ole that was opening up for our daughter .
- The age is just a number .
I wish I could stop it all .
well , it &apos;s here .
he insul@@ ted our bas@@ ket@@ ball teams .
we can &apos;t resist anymore !
what happened to philosophy teacher ?
I think it was on a point .
to your orders , Mr Inspector .
- Mad@@ ura , Fle@@ is@@ ch@@ man .
Chan@@ ta@@ je ?
the wisdom begins .
are you going to be able to review the ri@@ ghting system ?
Yes , of course I am .
where do you take me ?
no matter how you do it , it is only important to have to demand .
but it &apos;s Sophie S@@ dale , and his mother died in that apartment building , and I literally have been going to visit her every week .
I &apos;ve never been ass@@ aul@@ ted .
did you understand ?
this picture talks about the other .
where are you going ?
do you think I like being here ?
- You like it ?
we are pleased to have you with us .
I heard it was gone .
she touched my hand on dinner .
he fought 30@@ 7 before he was injured .
why can &apos;t you help him ... or not to have the results he wanted ?
- Good .
Amen .
no mistakes ?
did you like co @-@ co @-@ co @-@ co@@ con@@ s , a monster of cook@@ ies ?
Hey , Sergeant , send it here .
- We need more power .
because it sub@@ mits pictures and vag@@ ents that make it impossible for an answer .
- I can move on on the stage .
- Get out of my sight .
well , make a favor , and stay on the floor .
- I need you ...
Yes !
- Did you see him ?
sorry , I didn &apos;t see you .
and then stopped .
I told my colleague , &quot; women don &apos;t keep their daily papers unless they have anything to write . &quot;
you know , you didn &apos;t see anything ?
wait , Michael .
you better come .
damn it !
are you ready ?
- gold , with a beautiful stone .
but you must not cut it .
driving licence says that the victim is To@@ sh Walker .
we have a lot of work to do .
when you have a moment , there is something I would like to talk to you about .
I &apos;ve been contacted by a Bak@@ u report .
- He said no .
- Wait , left ?
D@@ us@@ k Allen , ED@@ M .
and that Ren@@ o@@ ir , he did all the col@@ ouring , ready all the photos .
- Ana from the Centre look .
I &apos;m not surprised that houses are cheap in Sun@@ n@@ y@@ dale .

Oh , is he ?
and now they eat , drink , enjoy .
sign here , here and here .
drop the bigger land in the history of the USA ..
come on .
the brain takes the information , as a new language , or a mathem@@ ati@@ cal equ@@ ation , much more quickly and it is better when that information comes through the music .
I thought it was the only reason why I was on the planet T@@ ier@@ lean , but then the floor collapsed under my and fell two flo@@ ats .
and I hope you will take your shir@@ ts before you get in the suit@@ case .
let me take my bag .
ladies and gentlemen , Michael Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re !

Su@@ fi , you go with A@@ vin@@ ash and G@@ ur@@ deep ... on the ashes of Ni@@ lu in the G@@ anges , in Har@@ d@@ war .
I wrote to you about the common f@@ lame of the war .
- You want me to look at it ?
it &apos;s a nin@@ ja .
now Natalie .
our military service is over .
two more c@@ enti@@ ters would be needed .
C@@ ly@@ de , if you want to blame B@@ uck , all right .
- Good .
they &apos;re trying to calm down the flam@@ es so they have better tr@@ action .
I hear them .
first , I think they were their background .
if I don &apos;t shoot , you &apos;d have killed us , Sarah .
it &apos;s pretty soon as to press the panic button , right ?
perfect , I finished .
what are you doing here ?
- Got it .
Gab@@ by is a great girl .
but behind all these are human beings , red lives .
what do you like more ?

Dr. H@@ anni@@ bal L@@ ec@@ ter asked for my company &apos;s pleasure for dinner .
when I try my theory , we will have saved the country from another revolution .
they want to arrest me .
and because , while I was Luci@@ fer , there was too much shit and it &apos;s a ri@@ b .
you liked the por@@ k and you wanted to get rid of your boyfriend .
&quot; we all hope . &quot;
of course , try to tell Dr. Cr@@ ane that .
and this is your health .
I need it back to the table now .
- There he is .
this is ridiculous .
I just know what I read in the newspapers .
you need to relax .
no nation , no matter how big or powerful can defeat these challenges alone .
he saved your life .
she even wants to have a baby .
do you know what they did to those men in that hill ?
damn it !
you don &apos;t know .
it probably has nothing to do with it .
M@@ arian !
peace is not easy to find ,
huh ?

do you have another card , sir ?
do it quiet .
now , every part of my body hurts to die .
I would never hate you .
my sister and I understand what you &apos;re doing .
I can go to a Japanese .
in love , you can &apos;t ...
- I &apos;ll take you .
look , I understand that being in prison is not an easy thing .
I &apos;m a veget@@ arian .
- You &apos;re welcome .
I &apos;m sick of this shit and I &apos;m not going to take it anymore !
I &apos;m I@@ g@@ or .
shut up !
I didn &apos;t know they were couple .
- Yeah .
before there was time , we were you and I .
the individual makes it big .
you &apos;re my feelings .
okay .
is it the best thing you can do , Father ?
- It &apos;s not honorable , it &apos;s personal .
I &apos;m , er , dis@@ concer@@ ted and cr@@ ashed !
here &apos;s your 10 pounds , sir .
- No , no .

put them down .
- Come on , Char@@ m .
it would be appreciated .
Hello , hello , hello !
- What do you mean ?
the fire is out .
if you die , I want another two .
what is this ?
unfortunately , we have that problem with the li@@ ghting ... and a full room of people who need medical care .
not sir .
because it &apos;s what Jesus , damn it , would do !
I doubt that this story will end here .
now , this proximity , the link between father and son , even to death of the victim ?
I signed more than 100 checks this morning .
Jane .
it failed !
they seem to be working , but no one can be .
let &apos;s see .

Barry no longer ... he &apos;s in his cell .

I &apos;ll be right back .
look at her !
no .
well ... aren &apos;t you gonna tell me the typical &quot; good work &quot; ?
see this ?
half of them probably killed illegally ...
what would surprise you is how expensive love is .
it &apos;s me . who else was going to be ?
what are we doing in the room ?
I &apos;m telling you one thing .
and I sleep alone , and I &apos;m afraid .
it is impossible to speak .
the real grows in a tree so that we did the best thing .
you didn &apos;t care about your ang@@ els .
my wife , Julie , is from New Jersey , 15 votes .
but it &apos;s fake .

it looks like someone hit her in the head .
all right , get it out of here , I gotta tell you guys , I &apos;m so happy to find him .
will you join the union ?
have you done the best to work ?
- I &apos;ll call .
&quot; shake your machine to make money &quot; or &quot; I know a ticket box . &quot;
Hey , Bruce !
he doesn &apos;t remember anything .
does that mean that the so@@ au d@@ anc@@ ers and the tor@@ ches are also back ?
K@@ atr@@ ina , as I appreciate your idea , I refuse to act misleading .
I was making a call .
the third and last dish that we would like to make a great deal of distance in a little more ... was drawn up by someone who knows clearly their can@@ s .
you have your area of speci@@ alisation , but basically you respond to me .
who is it ?
well , who I would like to see Christian dead probably killed Z@@ al@@ man to cover the crime .
I don &apos;t think of No@@ e .
I needed someone who could speak .

it &apos;s a great achievement for you .
that &apos;s right .
I leave the gun here and we &apos;re going to talk about the two .
she wouldn &apos;t fight .
sorry , Your Honor .
thank you .
what happened ?
the place in which Brian and I live previously worked .
I need to go back .
not to mention ...
it &apos;s small , but we like it .
sometimes it is only a matter of luck .
what is more beautiful than having someone in the loyal thr@@ one to us ?
- Hi Chris .
okay .
I don &apos;t care .
it &apos;s not our problem .
one .
- I &apos;m sorry .
you know the cat !
I know because we expl@@ ored it together .
- A@@ ur@@ yn ?
but if I am not mistaken and the evidence support my theory , it has happened in this desert .
it costs us billions of dollars .
I understand you can have sw@@ allowed some of the remains .
we forget how to trust people .
excuse me , excuse me .
we &apos;re bl@@ essed , isn &apos;t it ?
Oh , God .
damn .
you look like a king .
I talked to him , I &apos;ve scre@@ amed him .
you missed fun .
- Y@@ ale , Dad ?
we received it more than a month ago .
think about this as a second opportunity .
he said it &apos;s a cop .
keep your head down .
give it back !
come on , and make sure you stay in line with music .
come in ... the head ... of your friend !
physi@@ cs is not a competition .
- They &apos;re not .
Yeah .
you want everything .
just ... hold on .
- Thank you .
- Here ?
Maria Ti@@ fo@@ idea .
great .
Hey !
absolutely un@@ bear@@ able .
- There is no time to lose .
he &apos;s wearing ring .
I got things to read .
and your ass is cute .
well , they went away .
the plastic mel@@ ted by fire and in the process , the par@@ ticles covered by the Swiss .
if there is a problem , just tell him .
it &apos;s that ... it &apos;s like stri@@ pper .
who are you ?
- What delicious thing .
murder .
Oh , and Mark Matthew !
extremely un@@ bear@@ able .
- Come on , buddy .
but what is it that you cannot have more ?
my brother is crazy about me .
N@@ an Flan@@ agan is dead ?
what happened ?
okay , Henry .
if E@@ die doesn &apos;t know , that means you che@@ ated with me !
hate you for doing this .
you &apos;re Liz .
P@@ addy Bu@@ tton .
- You &apos;re interested in it .
&quot; please , &quot; please , put it to sleep at 21 : 30 .
Yeah .
there will be a small victory party for us .
and we hear your son testi@@ fying about his violence in the past .
I didn &apos;t take your eyes off , while you spoke with Mom on the phone .
all fixed , this is your money , Pol@@ ly , this is your j@@ ack ...
the pilot is a button ,
- Don &apos;t do anything stupid .
you &apos;re trying to get me up .
Oh , my God !
but we do not have Ali@@ en technology to build it .
he &apos;s listening .
Oh !
remember , keep your hands dirty and your clear mind .
no .
the world is full of sin@@ ners , Ryan , why do you think you picked them up to five ?
you wanted Owen !
all .
C@@ han says that during this morning .
why ?
I want your motor@@ cycle keys , that &apos;s what I want .
- This egg .
I don &apos;t know .
Taylor !
these are no@@ vel@@ s .
are you stupid , G@@ a@@ it@@ where &apos; ?
- I haven &apos;t been informed .
let me take care of the attack . anyone could call an ambulance ?
prepare the chest .
when he &apos;s clean , he &apos;ll be back .
the 911 call came from somewhere near here .
he can &apos;t have or@@ gas@@ ms .
- This cal@@ key has no idea .
- Mr My@@ cro@@ ft Holmes .
they are the best of the world !
not after what you did .
now ...
get your pants , C@@ ed@@ r@@ ic !
is that so important for you ?
please .
I have the connections .
prepare for school , M@@ ase .
talk about you there .
as if they thought that while the la@@ wn of the green front , short and beautiful , it does not necessarily mean what happens within the house .
my parents are a sno@@ bs .
Bec@@ k@@ ett .
in other words , it would blow into pieces .
I want to take a quick shower , too .
especially Mexico and Central America , do you know ?
it &apos;s a way to say .
you &apos;re okay .
I can &apos;t .
2 % of all the thi@@ eves get through the window of the second floor .
it seems that he had a drunk ...
- This is where you had your first kiss ?
I also make a p@@ enci@@ l .
Yeah .
why are you so long ?
be he or Dad .
shoot it , John .
- I think so .
there is nothing visible under the finger@@ n@@ ails .
it must be wise , and it will help .
- No , I &apos;ll call it .
not even for the next 10 days ?
when ?
only the poverty of spirit can do it .
you see , m@@ ouse would be in the middle of the night .
I &apos;m Dr. Baker .
eventually this place will feel like home .
well said .
here &apos;s the dol@@ ph@@ als .
you never know what the psy@@ chop@@ ing can be .
nice to meet you .
and his wife called .
okay , come here .
I am on the edge of the terr@@ ace , once again ... to look at this amazing view .
ten ?
- And he ?
what if she ends up with this decision ?
Ki@@ era , do you think that &apos;s wise ?
you &apos;re a horror .
- You didn &apos;t tell him .
you &apos;re so great !
I wasn &apos;t listening .
Grandpa Rick , where are we going ?
42 ... 4@@ 2@@ 12 .
the truth ?
- I won &apos;t leave .
Oh , no !
I would die before I serve Hy@@ dra , sick son of a bitch .
- Not really .
and I speak .
if something goes wrong can make an emergency area .
S@@ til , people believe that the Pre@@ dic@@ ator is Paul , is it not ?
- See ?
they gave them a list of terrorists that we have to release .
good night , friends .
- Really ?
asshole !
- Your enthusiasm , young man , but a lovely dog and enter@@ tainment a large crowd is not just games and fun .
similar .
the gentlemen are here .
Mag@@ cav@@ ede .
E@@ vel@@ yn disappeared over two years ago .
what should this be ?
- Sure .
_
I think the test is flawed ...
- Is it okay ?
see them in small por@@ tions .
and whatever my role in all this ... I have to believe that there is another way .
- Cer@@ k of Lin@@ us .
you have nothing to do with that .
F@@ ab@@ io Ki@@ xim@@ o , Rome to Car@@ t@@ ago .
so ... has he died ?
no , no , no , no .
- Mr S@@ pec@@ tor !
- It &apos;s a beautiful city .
- See you .
- I agree , but there is a problem .
the body of the woman we pulled out yesterday in B@@ und@@ ang ... his husband and children were found dead this morning .
why are you doing these things ?
as me , he learned to survive and re@@ inv@@ ent himself .
you have been very helpful .
and in spite of what some people say , it &apos;s not back .
wait .
I &apos;m sorry .
Jack !
- Mom , you imagine what ?
thank you , Paul , it &apos;s okay .
- Maybe it was the smell of coffee .
because I left you with less staff ?
- Me too !
get out and ass !
- Everything will be fine .
I don &apos;t want to fight .
this is my family now .
my intention was always to be with Kh@@ itan .
you see something lost .
Hi .
Wil@@ bur , you did this movie ?
but do you know a little about the relationship between the rest of Canada ?
there is also a huge variety of animals that save , play and wake up everyone .
I wonder how many of my men sent to death .
this is in@@ descri@@ p@@ able !
sheriff C@@ ob@@ b always used to take me when they were very important days .
I have no idea .
wait !
in my mind , everything to a perfect thing ... a silver bullet , something to do with lu@@ pus disappear and will have ended with him forever .
super .
- Why didn &apos;t you go ?
very good .
gentlemen , what can I do ?
Yeah , well , the last time I heard from you , Black Dr@@ agon , was closed in the mountains of 100 years .
emo@@ tionally , yes .
four months ago , I got fired .
is it that they have gone mad ?
Ben C@@ ory , manager . can you stop taking pictures ?
and you don &apos;t get in my way ?
- But what does that have to do with ...
you &apos;ll wake Emma .
I saw Mr Re@@ yes .
you know that kind of thing I &apos;m not interested in , Boy@@ d .
you knew I &apos;d see her .
Hi .
$ 500 ?
- Thank you .
I gave you many .
I say you do what makes you happy .
kiss !
I &apos;ll organise a meeting for you to meet Uncle Bill .
you , with your refin@@ ed ideas and your qu@@ is@@ si@@ l@@ ous st@@ atic , will always have a nic@@ kel public , but this guy , there is such a universal thing .
he studied law , right ?
executed .
- He &apos;s sleeping ...
we work very well in team .
Owen Charles Boy@@ d &apos;s cat is a woman .
Philli@@ p jumped out with me , and everyone has the ring .
here the Doctor .
we &apos;re wasting time .
you ... recorded your room .
come on , come on !
they &apos;re acid .
if you kill drunk , you &apos;re responsible .
well , good .
you &apos;re exagger@@ ating .
no , I &apos;m sorry .
sure .
Ri@@ k@@ ard gave me something Tommy had to have .
that was boring .
so I put glu@@ e in it and in this ... and wait for you to get out of contact .
only with her ?
if you want to produce milk , a mother must drink water .
Hey .
- Okay .
there &apos;s no Jack and I .
- We have everything planned .
Mr Ry@@ land ...
G@@ ina was attacked in my party , Dad .
sir , with the power of your word , you had the chaos of the primi@@ tive seas ...
we are in 198@@ 3 Cameron .
it was personal for me .
I &apos;m going , Jef@@ fe@@ y .
they &apos;re filled with explosive traps .
- In football training .
Yeah , I &apos;ll tell you what .
I didn &apos;t want you to see me like that .
Oh , I don &apos;t want that .
- Did you ?
there is nothing to condemn in my report .
it &apos;s all in the closet .
just to the daughter of the Empi@@ re who was looking for .
- Get ready .
- Come on , Johnny , you &apos;re a hero .
there &apos;s a back@@ way to the coast .
with this ring ...
and I could see my enemies , our col@@ ours - the Ju@@ des !
it is a pro@@ phy@@ logy of crime , dis@@ soci@@ al and the A@@ the@@ ism .
someone must have done so .
everywhere .
these animals are practical travellers , Mr Barro@@ ws .
okay .
and you never will .
it will soon be the day when you will have to decide whether or not you adopt the random philosophy or human .
- Jo@@ yce ?
this ends right here , everything .
this is the way things are in these times .
- Oh , as a proud father ... I was seeing V@@ ir destroy the place .
no , no .
much better .
Queen !
I &apos;m here to help you !
Hey !
I do .
- You want to come ?
right ?
let me call my own .
and they would be persuaded without any doubt that they are their accusations .
but I &apos;m very hungry .
I think I can do it .
what &apos;s going on ?
why lie on the act when I see your wife ?
Hey .
if you have just chosen one .
you &apos;re very confident .
your father .
Ellen , did you get those pictures to the media ?
I &apos;m on diet .
it has an incredible view .
I can &apos;t do this to P@@ am .
I decided to accept your offer .
Yeah , but it &apos;s not cooking food , right ?
well , I have a question here for you .
I &apos;ve had two times in Special In@@ ities , I love my grandmother , and she could die .
we can &apos;t find our K@@ inder eggs .
what do you have to do with Er@@ in ?
that &apos;s why they pay me very well .
- See what you &apos;ve done ?
Hi . how are you ?
we cannot get closer , nor use it in our research .
looking for a girl .
look .
please do it .
- Our child has been drinking a lot ...
they &apos;ll give you high tomorrow , after your last medication .
no , no . why ?
they must be crus@@ hed by the power of their votes .
Yeah .
it &apos;s not easy for me always to look good .
don &apos;t get near !
you &apos;re going to dis@@ close , okay ?
- You &apos;re on duty ?
that is the reason for Ne@@ al has recru@@ ited someone to ap@@ tain the procedures .
there is too much weight given to the no@@ ve@@ lists , and it ignores the po@@ e@@ try and the tragedies .
I &apos;ll wait until late , okay ?
you &apos;ll probably send someone you know ...
maybe the thre@@ ad wasn &apos;t so committed .
I just was just a band ...
Hey , I like this .
do you have to torture me with your lies ?
$ 2@@ 60 , guys . that &apos;s too low to pur@@ ge like these !
but she knows what she &apos;s doing , and she &apos;s not going to go home .
take these 50 ling@@ ers as a welcome gift .
you don &apos;t want to throw yourself into this .
excuse me .
but the moon is not made of rock or stone , right ?
for a million , I would also change my principles .
I take the step away .
in the neck you have between legs .
his daughter , his only daughter died in 63 .
Oh , my God , I &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s not because he &apos;s sitting .
- Like you .
less James Earl .
and he says , &quot; I thought he was dead . &quot;
we both have something in common .
the stars ...
we &apos;ll take care of the cleaning .
Oh , it &apos;s okay to look ...
look , it looks like our boy , Greg@@ ory Mal@@ ina , is going to state after all .
I got a letter from the football partnership .
doubt yourself .
#
you &apos;re out of the house .
three .
why did you not say who was ?
it looks like they &apos;re friends .
- Thank you , Lieutenant .
I have just spoken to the path@@ olog@@ ist and according to the d@@ ental pl@@ ates and details of his medical file , the identification is positive .
why don &apos;t you go and buy a few of the teaching classes with this ?
okay , doctor .
my lights ?
I always have it .
are you talking to them ?
Yeah , but those g@@ loves would also be useful to str@@ angle that poor girl without any foot@@ print .
you can &apos;t stand the slightest criticism .
my money was stolen every day before I get to the bus .
Yeah . who would use this in public ?
- Oh God .
I won &apos;t tell you , I wouldn &apos;t believe it .
if you see or listen to someone , I want you to tell me fast .
all you have shown is that Lee Mic@@ ha@@ els was a bad guy .
quick now , close the doors .
I realized it wasn &apos;t the time .
we &apos;re leaving tonight .
here .
this is not a negotiation Mr Walker .
you love me .
look at us .
me too .
I see you at the moment .
you thought that ?
just on the other side of the natural world , your size has a profound effect on your temp@@ at pace , in your &quot; life speed &apos; .
you tried to kill yourself , Catherine .
Yeah .
las@@ er and everything ... clean work .
a fight club ?
come on !
Oh , we &apos;re not going on the plane .
why are we stuck in clubs and crying and sha@@ king like babies ?
I &apos;m even better than her .
we will continue with the interview tomorrow .
we do not recognise any authority , except within us .
there are too many shots , but the second amendment of the Constitution guarantees certain rights .
W@@ hist@@ ler .
- I know you &apos;re solv@@ ent .
it &apos;s the cost of this bottle .
it &apos;s nothing good to be dancing on TV with that black music .
and you can think , you can &apos;t be defeated .
I like your face as it is .
that &apos;s what happens when you don &apos;t work .
you &apos;re blood .
- Don &apos;t hurt him !
of course .
why would it invest in a small and desperate way of pon@@ ds ?
Wednesday at 7 a.m.
God , you &apos;re adorable .
no , honey , it &apos;s not .
they have to jump three ranks .
how could anyone forget it ?
it &apos;s an eng@@ in@@ eer .
the boss is upstairs in my office .
the cof@@ fers must be with a sti@@ ker or two ?
don &apos;t get mad , he doesn &apos;t have batteries .
this is appalling . &quot;
it &apos;s the last , and I wanted one .
- Let &apos;s go more .
the time to make progress .
I just know who .
Hey , those are great .
and the offer .
this is about the adoption agreement .
it may be a police commissioner , but we are the Commissioners of the city .
Mike is on the other side of the street looking to make sure that I &apos;m sorry , despite the fact that it is clear that you are the one who should be apologi@@ zing by the way you ruined my party .
tell Don@@ o@@ van that we need a warrant for the house of Bur@@ ches right now .
- I guess .
he hasn &apos;t put the plu@@ g on the bottle for a long time .
for problems with Maria .
get out .
that &apos;s what counts .
I mean ... more than I never liked any other girl .
I lost it !
- Fi@@ ve minutes .
what the hell is going on , man !
what &apos;s up , honey ?
nothing has happened yet .
special edi@@ tion .
I mean , I ... you know that I want kids here .
but we will improve , you will see .
well , the last time we spoke , you were on the way to stop Hel@@ ena Ber@@ tin@@ elli from his war against the mafia .
- You don &apos;t have balls !
I &apos;m a ...
Oh , well , the old bi@@ bu@@ es like you call him , looks like he knows his name , and he said he gets a dollar for every report , and he gave him $ 5@@ .00 , and he told him &quot; hal@@ t &apos; .
you wouldn &apos;t be here if I had known .
no , no , no .
I don &apos;t care about your future anymore .
you &apos;re right .
so ?
Ken@@ kic@@ hi can take some way home .
it was the man with power .
- Why do you do this ?
- Jo@@ anne .
he was my friend .
no rules and restrictive .
the bra@@ ke , Philli@@ p !
my father was murdered when I had 12 , almost 13 years .
I &apos;m serious , J@@ i H@@ yo .
I need you to see it .
I would like to end this useless life .
&#91; cell phone rings &#93;
- Pir@@ ate ?
what about him ?
excuse me , Sand@@ ra .
- Yeah , I know .
you &apos;re pretty good , you should be teacher .
okay .
don &apos;t fly without it .
we &apos;ll win the big thing .
there &apos;s something bother@@ ing me .
I think you mean the Prince Bern@@ hard of Holland .
the kind of mind that could concei@@ ve something so di@@ abo@@ tic ...
you have no experience acting and don &apos;t do well .
in some never rain .
we spend the idea of being partners to the Gar@@ za boy , Fu@@ entes .
iv@@ ory Ag@@ ory 4 .
and , uh , it was supposed to be for three days .
Kevin Dor@@ f@@ man , it was a birthday present .
you can go far in anything , Lady Catherine .
are you here ?
you spend most of the time being ... you know ... you and then write something like this for me .
what did you do ?
I &apos;m flat@@ tered that you think , of all people on this planet , I know how to find the drunk , but I am disappointed .
how long have you got the pain in your back ?
it &apos;s slow@@ ing , but very little .
he changed his name .
I mean , you said S@@ iro .
you have nothing to offer .
if it &apos;s hard for you not to talk about it .
or dying like bott@@ les burned down .
there are plenty of good men in there .
&quot; the situation is calm .
no .
I don &apos;t know what to think .
you call this the Grand Central St@@ ation ?
Tr@@ abu@@ r@@ es and tor@@ s .
you can &apos;t escape .
what will he know ?
you must get rid of them .
do it !
put the uniform together .
thank you .
and I felt ashamed .
let &apos;s take him .
okay , okay .
it seems that Sk@@ ye could end up being more than a consul@@ tant , despite our reservations .
wait .
not just in some bar@@ rels .
Yeah .
- Let go of it !
I don &apos;t know .
what did you tell the Doctor ?
there is a system of cam@@ el in the car .
you mean dying , right ?
- That &apos;s our daughter !
Yeah .
was he nervous ?
- You &apos;re angry , it &apos;s normal .
I was on the threshold of your door to the edge of the dem@@ enti@@ a , with af@@ lic@@ tion .
are you really okay ?
and you call a request .
$ 17@@ .000 , and yeah , I slept with him .
Cur@@ ly , we can &apos;t ...
- But it &apos;s only provisional .
no !
a joke ?
all right , do me a favor and explain to your ship .
you know what ?
you saw our children .
- Mr H@@ off@@ a ?
sadly we cannot choose where they send us .
it &apos;s a friend of a friend of some time .
bring him a co@@ gn@@ aci@@ t .
and then I lost your number .
- I love deals .
- It could be the hospital .
you &apos;re super smart .
so , B@@ ust@@ er took his proper@@ ties ... and he was emancip@@ ated from his mom .
wasn &apos;t Colonel O &apos;@@ Nei@@ ll the pilot of that mission ?
keep doing what you &apos;re doing .
you are a dream of reality .
it raises a communication barrier .
Henry took the next exit .
I said that it is the ro@@ pes or the am@@ ples &quot; com@@ ec@@ er@@ eb@@ os . &quot;
he saw a way out , and he took it .
you ...
you &apos;re going to kill me !
well , I &apos;ll save enough money , and I &apos;ll have my own house .
well , tomorrow take some other part
you &apos;re not gonna try to find Mo@@ on@@ ey ?
but I have to protect Fit@@ zy .
- Thank you , Javier , do not need .
see you in Cal@@ las , Tuesday at 7 ?
I &apos;m sorry .
do you want to talk ?
well , I &apos;ll tell Eric .
Hey , J@@ er ?
three weeks ago , we do not .
we must find a new sound .
you look worried .
- Exac@@ tly .
it is vital that you take what I have left for you ... to C@@ rich@@ ton of Mo@@ ya .
how do you think we got here ?
I@@ stan@@ bul is rock .
and that big truck .
the dream was gone further ?
why don &apos;t you shut up at once ?
they got us .
really ?
the number he has marked has been dis@@ connected ...
now .
I have serious problems .
&quot; why don &apos;t you try to sell a book to someone ?
I didn &apos;t hear it .
you heard what I said , N@@ ing@@ one .
no , dark j@@ ick@@ bra !
so Leo knows who it is ?
tell me , but don &apos;t tell me how to say .
skin skin , bear skin
I could almost give you the thr@@ one .
- Yeah .
we fil@@ med up late .
a good guy .
I want the child .
an extra !
it is in fact located in an area designated by the cen@@ sus called Par@@ adi@@ so .
- I &apos;m not sorry .
- Tell Bec@@ ky .
you have no idea who you are dealing with .
so ...
and what better way of doing what he wants ?
- Yeah .
who are you ?
we don &apos;t even know where the old tape got out .
all right , you can write what you want .
no , no , it &apos;s not the battery .
okay .
Fred , I have to say that I do not feel very well talking to you with that gun that was pointed out in my face .
Wow , have you been in any of those games ?
I have to break the swe@@ ater of swe@@ ater , to show my shoulder .
V@@ asi@@ ly ?
- Long time he took this curse .
he was at a directors conference in London .
- How can we be imprisoned ?
in the chair .
that can change everything .
- Luke !
here at the table of those who acted in Paris .
DNA is exactly the judge of Jud@@ ge Joseph D@@ red@@ d .
come on .
well , this has to stop .
it &apos;s never been better .
come on .
and I was the last one who spoke to her .
after Duc@@ ky makes the auto@@ psy , we will be able to calcul@@ ate the post @-@ mort@@ em post @-@ mort@@ em weather in the face of the weight that it had to be the weight of O@@ w@@ ens underground .
whatever .
you have been .
listen !
do you think this is funny ?
to keep that crazy father out of her , for Jesus , to hit her .
we think that the burden of cargo ended up .
you tell me , or I mean , why ?
everything I &apos;ve worked on will go to the c@@ ast .
I love doing things well , the ethical ro@@ yal .
thank you .
he was dru@@ gged , man .
you don &apos;t want to hang around ?
- Well , where &apos;s your ship ?
this is my big night with Jessica
no , don &apos;t , Tar@@ z@@ án .
God e@@ ternal , whatever it is !
are you sure ?
take the course !
now .
tea ?
Yeah .
come on , come on .
it contains things .
come on .
Oh , hi .
Wy@@ lie Du@@ str@@ ne is going to make a surprise for surprise tonight .
I regret your loss .
and how are you called ?
- Lieutenant .
that is why the UN decided to take control of the ends .
I would like it to be so easy .
mom , you shot him .
Director , you bear them !
okay ?
just to agree with what I want ?
you seem to be looking after the child .
what did you want me to do ?
thank you ... for accepting the post .
and we &apos;ll see you on Monday , okay ?
I have the same problem with Di@@ N@@ oz@@ zo .
but he doesn &apos;t listen .
- He &apos;s right .
Kit@@ ar@@ o .
I didn &apos;t spend my day of yesterday washing out the clothes so that I could come here as a German tourist with a wood leg .
Oh , yeah , yeah , sure .
well , what exactly are you saying ?
if I ever kill you , your eyes will be completely open .
who pays $ 3@@ 00,000 to blind , Dean to someone who has never done business ?
you &apos;re still a baby .
Mm @-@ hmm .
were you out of the plane and landed in your face ?
a passenger who will enjoy having someone who draws his needs at first class
she has always been a little nic@@ kel .
it can reduce the class @-@ class sentence 10 years , I will be outside five .
one of the main tourist groups where I grew up , and I was addic@@ ted .
- Do you want to sit down , Donna Lu@@ cia ?
- In private .
Anna !
Er@@ min@@ io .
- Yes , sir .
start here .
they can be my best friends , but the question of my vir@@ gin@@ ity calls for a total and in@@ tric@@ ate cruel@@ ty .
- Yeah .
can I give you some pe@@ anu@@ ts ?
that &apos;s the region 12 .
well , we still have Syrian funds , right ?
- Right .
- Fred@@ die .
arrest them alone .
- We will share the benefit .
- Let &apos;s eat .
bye .
Yes , sir .
my sister Ro@@ sie has two more years than me .
you &apos;ll tell me everything , now .
what do you work for ?
- What is that ?
they &apos;re the best customers , believe me .
what &apos;s going on ?
Harold , there are more things in life than work .
Yeah , yeah .
but only a song , and it has to be something connected , like two for two .
my condolences for your loss .
what , then we still accept the Kremlin &apos;s orders ?
- Yeah .
there are still 4@@ 0,000 in actions of Jun@@ g@@ burgh .
I &apos;m glad that it was useful , George .
he &apos;s dead .
of course , I am afraid of some own ingredients .
a refriger@@ ation ?
do you want me to be ready for my return ?
I &apos;m the owner of this place .
shut up !
now tell that asshole that he is returning our lives a hell .
- We don &apos;t know .
you stole my story !
but I &apos;ll tell you how a man wanted her out of this game .
I &apos;m probably jealous .
you &apos;re an astron@@ au@@ t trained , right ?
- What do you want from me ?
you tell him the truth as the last time , he could not con@@ quer , the deci@@ de@@ dly dies .
- Don &apos;t let us do this in the morning ?
to take advantage of you ?
huh ?
- What was his name ?
a connection with the bullet .
Bernard , yeah .
I &apos;m happy for you .
three : it &apos;s a white screen ...
quick , quick !
Pro@@ k@@ ó@@ fic@@ h , don &apos;t pull the horse on the cross@@ roads , because I felt there yesterday .
- Bye , Wor@@ f .
- A lawyer for refugees !
so you &apos;re not planning to take things seriously in the future ?
what do you find more difficult ?
lucky .
go ahead , guys .
- I want to see Lor@@ ry .
could be anybody
come on .
Oh , my God .
hurry up .
but just a second .
a very special woman .
shit , did you fuck Mar@@ cin@@ ho ?
I don &apos;t know , Peter .
us ?
gre@@ et@@ ings , Martin .
I &apos;ll go home to do that .
neither you nor me know ..
I &apos;ve known the Colonel C@@ arr@@ ington for 20 years .
you wanted a short@@ cut and you got into force , bringing the anger of the Bu@@ f@@ on with you !
should we take care of him ?
the massacre is a lost tri@@ angle between Wil@@ shire , Central and F@@ arm@@ ington .
a man must be strong for him to respect him , but he is weak to him .
it &apos;s the first time I make love with another man from divorce .
she &apos;s got apartment partners , they &apos;re artists .
this is the US@@ B found in N@@ am U@@ I &apos;s mouth .
let &apos;s go .
not being more connected with an invisible thre@@ ad ... to a body outside me .
I don &apos;t want to get rid of your little girl .
Oh , yeah ?
you want me to come back to A@@ sh Park ?
it looks like a real road trip .
what kind of blow is that ?
because I want a new car ?
I wouldn &apos;t say that .
I &apos;ve just been with him here 45 minutes ago .
I &apos;ll give you several .
I hope your form of life will meet !
- It &apos;s not safe !
there &apos;s something I must give to a person , then they can do what they want with me .
well , because my client , Mrs T@@ in@@ s@@ ley , believes that collection is under@@ valued in this economy and his husband would not want her to sell her for less than she is worth .
Teddy .
tea , two lem@@ ons .
- It was Al Qaeda .
here we go .
Y@@ ura has nothing to do with that .
no .
this can be the Earth !
I need ... a doctor who ...
tell him he did nothing wrong .
you said 10 , right ?
Yeah .
- God .
that &apos;s the truth .
bye .
you don &apos;t have to do that !
- Now .
Cho@@ za !
- And you believed him ?
right .
- Okay .
tell your wife .
we , we dis@@ guise .
your father thinks he &apos;s in the temp@@ le of the mountains !
there &apos;s nothing left !
you &apos;re not coming to see me .
I know .
- Can we talk ?
I have some capital , but I need more than $ 30@@ ,000 .
together with four dozen others who come here every summer .
Yeah , I got it .
I understand , but this is out of place .
and you in reserve , wait for my signal .
somewhere I &apos;ll go !
I just hope you like the company .
- No .
well , if Brian was cam@@ ping , why was he there and how is it possible that nobody knew ?
besides , I &apos;m not going to finish it today .
right .
where the kidn@@ ap@@ pers had to meet , there is no trace of them .
master , excuse me , it was the Vienna Fi@@ lar@@ mom@@ ic ...
what do you do , H@@ aj@@ j ?
the aim of the game is to eliminate the ri@@ vals .
you just need to light it to 175 degrees to that of 5 : 15 .
why are you invited to a &quot; du@@ el meeting &quot;
- Anna ?
Oh , really ?
then I will do so quickly .
we &apos;ll be three of here , okay ?
I will share something interesting with you that I heard of some of my officers .
Hey Pete , how do I know that the col@@ ors you see are the same as I see ?
you cannot deliver the country to an ex@@ ile ex@@ ile and a group of Washington .
stop being so bad !
- Pu@@ t it down .
little sister ?
so tonight ?
are you still looking at your eyes when you look ?
- We are both for legal .
if I had listened to your mother , would you not even have been born ?
why is this happening ?
and , so far , I couldn &apos;t escape her .
- All right , keep it all .
did they follow us ?
what do you mean ?
we &apos;ll take you to hospital , okay ?
okay , that &apos;s all we need .
I always wondered why Dad had put a car@@ p@@ enter shop .
we are floo@@ ded from the public raid .
come with me .
- Mo@@ ve .
Dav@@ ee , what the hell do we do ?
Yeah , yeah .
no .
it &apos;s like I know the person who lives here .
this is a nightmare !
who is it ?
we did a deal to record the next Fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood Mac record in S@@ ound City .
he made a number of visits to the Ministry of Health , Lab@@ or and Bi@@ en@@ being to check this out .
bastard !
P@@ indy ?
I can &apos;t be smart , but I knew you had a reason to justify you .
- Yeah .
I found 3 of the 1980s in the system .
no , don &apos;t worry , Inspector .
nothing goes well .
- What ?
but your wid@@ ow , Mrs Pack , testi@@ fies that this afternoon did not come .
that &apos;s not why .
too many by@@ passes .
on the floor , there is no law .
who has the best pictures of vag@@ inas ?
&quot; the side behind his for@@ ti@@ ti@@ ations , will be defeated . &quot;
we want to find the guerri@@ lla .
I don &apos;t know .
and I made a promise after they were born .
it should not be possible , Mr E@@ ren , on the condition of E@@ ren when it comes from the tit@@ le , I think it is unlikely .
and I still don &apos;t know .
yesterday , when someone decided to leave early and left me all the mer@@ chan@@ dise .
maybe I &apos;ll give it back .
N@@ ex@@ tro@@ n wants to buy it and become a re@@ creation centre .
it &apos;s Agent Or@@ kin@@ ñ@@ ez .
get up .
it is not .
no , it &apos;s too much .
some will have hundreds of them .
but I want to join Ox@@ ford , perhaps , D@@ ak@@ in .
well , pigs can fly .
my life may not be many things , but I am discre@@ et .
- In your interview .
it still works .
I went to help my uncle in the harvest .
I must know .
we think we might have failed Terry , but in his note he said no .
King wants to see me ?
- No .
I have many reservations .
- I loved it .
exactly , sir .
get this shit music !
if I get closer , Joey will start a conversation , while we stop feeling strang@@ ers and let us dis@@ appoint ourselves for such an amazing meeting .
- Nicole didn &apos;t believe it relevant .
and I &apos;m here because I &apos;m worried .
1 500 boxes , there .
the sun in heaven has a smile in the face .
- Os@@ cure .
leave your nose .
I found your number in my dog &apos;s neck .
we &apos;re in ...
don &apos;t try .
that &apos;s our favorite joke .
the final ones .
no .
- Did you see that ?
come on , girls , go change .
I am , however , fascin@@ ated by the persist@@ s .
finally , the cleaning staff have a friendly reminder .
this is the subject of ... this .
I &apos;m sure some of the fishermen will cut it and use it .
- Mo@@ ve !
ma &apos;am ?
then I &apos;m going .
- What the hell are you doing ?
does it happen well ?
Yeah , it uses one of our no@@ ts to enter the D@@ ank@@ . state of State .
we need to dig out of here .
one was a pir@@ ate , and the other two ad@@ ners have been punished with their own sins .
fucking disgusting !
what are you doing ?
cow@@ boy , how &apos;s Colonel Blake ?
- I love you , Marshall .
No@@ é did exactly what God told him
maybe you .
- We must go over there more often .
- I &apos;m lucky .
if I speak , everyone will know that I was .
she knows .
Ur@@ lac@@ her will never agree with this .
did you fight this week ?
what are we going to do ?
I &apos;m gonna go for a second to muse@@ um .
- Well , I had ten years , it was with my father , and I have clearly heard a very big one on the other side of the lake .
- Good night .
why ?
okay .
what the fuck is that ?
congratulations .
look at that cabin .
no .
well , I think it &apos;s a big store .
Iv@@ ani@@ to !
come on , quick , quick .
- And then you , well ...
the only qu@@ em ...
what is the good thing ?
Yes , it is .
you have your face .
what did you feel about Dad at this time ?
all right ...
he &apos;s so lucky . &quot;
I saw him in the cinema .
do you want to get rid of those bodies ?
we need to take it easy .
and I want you to love me .
- Sure , you can .
break @-@ rules .
I don &apos;t remember anything and I remember .
- A my@@ tic treasure ?
Sh@@ ad@@ ay@@ im ?
don &apos;t tell me , really ?
or fish .
what ?
go and kill you for that money !
she &apos;s in some way here , as a patient , of course .
as a drop of blood contains DNA .
they want to see an explosion that will save the L@@ una .
- Yeah .
okay .
what if they never cut it ?
what have we lived for ?
Charlie .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re gonna see tonight .
he didn &apos;t grab my credit card .
N@@ at .
music helps ...
it &apos;s not Pierre .
a je@@ w@@ man .
can you try this for a while ?
that &apos;s a pity .
it &apos;s the most beautiful thing in the world .
good morning !
St@@ acey , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
Hey , I gotta go .
I &apos;m talking about Mom and I &apos;m going .
that was the last time we &apos;ve heard from M@@ ia .
even when we divorced .
you &apos;ll call , now the line is busy .
maybe there was an accident in the sub@@ way .
can I drink a glass of water ?
I saw one of those creatures in Or@@ leans .
and ...
where are the other mag@@ ici@@ ans ?
the man turned around and ran out .
come on !
they loved you .
I &apos;ll call the police !
To@@ do@@ s@@ los@@ sis and care .
it &apos;s the best thing , man .
very nice .
he looks at the old lady &apos;s department .
he says , &quot; Well , do you know anything about sp@@ ider ?
stop !
I need time to think .
you will enjoy , Mrs Oliver .
Ne@@ eli@@ x , get your mess out .
I &apos;ll tell you later .
sister !
- M@@ uni@@ tion !
get your mouth off your mouth .
he is accu@@ sing him .
even for someone driving a fast car , it is a long journey , and the ali@@ ons flying over the acceler@@ ator make the journey in a second @-@ fold .
the alleged trans@@ genic threat is still in the first place .
K@@ ul@@ je@@ et .
my idiot .
it &apos;s 10 : 15 .
you seem to have experienced the visit from the Fant@@ as@@ mass@@ ur .
put it down .
- A glass of milk , please .
it just needs to think that I &apos;m doing a commercial and he &apos;ll do one .
- They &apos;ll make an analysis in the hospital .
many things , but why do you say they &apos;re mine ?
the hy@@ per@@ engine seems to be dis@@ connected .
nothing is going to change between us .
four months since the permits and have not done the half .
- Did you tell the station ?
I probably thought I should go un@@ noticed for a while , is that the general trend ?
they doubled the prize , 500 bucks .
we both know where it was .
Yeah , I &apos;ve seen you .
- Yes , sir .
are you leaving ?
we need the president to come to D@@ ade Coun@@ ty to speak with the wid@@ ow of the taxi who blew his head .
why would I ?
and the cel@@ eb@@ age had no such structure .
I have to go to Vegas to tell them that everything will be fine .
get out of my fucking way !
thank you .
we have never been separated so long , so it will be difficult , definitely .
- Do it a little more .
op@@ pres@@ sive the recording button .
is that the Os@@ cure Park ?
is it clear ?
what exactly does this f@@ uss do ?
Hey , now you &apos;re wearing purse ?
how many Pi@@ eter is there ?
come on , what &apos;s the worst thing that could happen to him ?
I know .
Yes , Prince Mik@@ ah .
it would be faster .
Paul An@@ ka the dog .
I don &apos;t remember any other girl !
gre@@ edy gre@@ edy .
Yeah .
I &apos;ve already said I &apos;m the only bl@@ onde here .
E@@ lo@@ die , if we do not risk , there are good people who will die .
he &apos;s always playing .
don &apos;t embarr@@ ass me when you &apos;re facing God , Naz@@ ar@@ eno .
we already saw the two walking on the mall .
I really cannot , I have to go .
bye .
we can &apos;t do that .
I knew it .
- No .
you are always looking for news
I can &apos;t put it right now , because I &apos;m living in my life right now .
I think it &apos;s time we left .
I &apos;ll be back in a moment , right ?
what about the S@@ deaf gun ?
I didn &apos;t know it was a relative .
I just felt that in@@ contain@@ able desire to feel nothing more than being unhappy ever again .
shut up , okay ?
it &apos;s time to grow , guys .
pain leads to the disturb@@ ance of the psy@@ cho .
they will work with their armed forces , to strengthen their borders , but they understand that they will do it equality and justice .
you &apos;re putting a great deal of cruel@@ ty about me and I beg you to stop doing so .
... it &apos;s never going back ...
I don &apos;t know today .
what are they doing ?
&quot; small &quot; that &apos;s good .
what the hell are you doing ?
- What do you mean ?
Hi .
wait .
we can take a boat , guys !
we have the methods and tools ... to show the truth .
Yeah , he took us to a ( ble@@ ep ) I &apos;m going to get it off .
life is too short .
- Okay .
- You &apos;re right , love .
and when we finally go home I &apos;m sure we will have many memories .
Lieutenant ?
on the shirt and pants .
a super soldier .
okay , buddy .
would the Mar@@ qu@@ és be living in a po@@ le like this ?
- Give it to me !
don &apos;t leave ice cream ...
we were very close then .
and , recently , I discovered that my mother ...
excuse me .
and you are ...
I was stuck in two hours under an im@@ par@@ able metal Lincoln , enough to cause you a apo@@ ple@@ j@@ y to anyone .
I promise you .
Jesse , Jesse , Jesse , listen to me .
I was convinced of Lam@@ ar@@ ck &apos;s ideas .
of course not .
the Mo@@ du@@ s react to Ta@@ el@@ ons protocols .
and this young man ?
his name is Lor@@ ena .
Yeah , I heard .
Hey , Pic@@ as@@ so !
is that busy husband busy ?
I am a philo@@ sop@@ her and I am not attracted so much .
no , I &apos;m serious .
when I was 11 , I wanted to marry you .
okay .
I was pregnant after you broke up !
why don &apos;t you help me ?
and now , I want to be happy again .
&#91; I hated my father ...
can you tear down the door ?
your direc@@ tives will believe you .
you think she did this ?
no !
do you think that science is veget@@ arian ?
more , we have been born to love .
shut up .
nothing interesting to say .
it is our president , sir .
John , we have to continue our search .
I hate you guys .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
that &apos;s why you want to win for him .
I used to make security work at the end of the pa@@ inst@@ in@@ age .
have I got a lawyer ?
I will lead to freedom .
I know all the marks .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll see you again in months .
I ... I &apos;ll take off the middle .
what are you doing in your car ?
okay .
how much ?
don &apos;t worry , your father has already made sense .
I shared your tears .
it was very heavy .
well done , Nick .
I found the gun .
wait , Captain .
when the police arrived , I was dead .
no , that &apos;s not gonna work .
I worked so much in those vi@@ deos .
you never hear me .
two .
I miss you so much .
all right , what I call said that she &apos;s dead to her , 8 : 20 ?
and that &apos;s it ?
excuse me , Barry Dun@@ ne lives here ?
so long as M@@ ack S@@ wa@@ in is to have hall@@ uc@@ in@@ ation .
- It &apos;s all right .
who told you that my wife left me ?
business .
could I have acted differently without losing your artistic integrity ?
I don &apos;t want to see them dressed .
if you want ...
once !
I wanted to see you , so I came , but ...
what does this tat@@ too mean for you ?
the conditions of the factory are also a disaster .
- Yes !
- No , I &apos;m saying it because I &apos;m very little to do , and you can come or ... or I can go .
not to spend vacation together , but the years and we were unable to meet a meal of Ram@@ ad@@ an .
the boys also talk about corn .
please .
Yeah , it &apos;s pretty .
Colin &apos;s parents do not want it there .
- Okay .
- To your posts .
it may not have a great education , but it is in@@ offensive .
you &apos;re the bastard planning 9 / 11 multipli@@ ed by a thousand .
- Excuse me .
where &apos;s the body ?
No@@ ah ...
didn &apos;t I tell you ?
as the cost@@ u@@ me put me in a little bit .
it was your li@@ ght@@ ning that sent the drag@@ on to his universe .
he &apos;s Tony .
- You know America ?
still ?
the replacement of V@@ ey@@ ron .
- Good night , doctor .
help me , help me !
Yeah ?
it is a whole industry built on air .
mom , you know who was ?
sorry .
strong armed He@@ lic@@ op@@ ers ?
- Really ?
- It &apos;s gone !
stay .
Oh , my God !
no one must die with empty stomach .
what can you pay me ?
- Bye !
after what you wrote about Brian ?
Oh , my son ...
your mother and your sister are not even here .
how much do you get for this ?
life can be complicated now , but sooner or later .
- Where &apos;s Molly ?
get him .
the formula is on the Internet , and the components everywhere .
- No , sir .
&quot; I must talk to my soul .
I &apos;m sick of games .
- But if you had lost ?
let &apos;s do the same .
- V@@ esta Rose
baby , you can &apos;t give Ben@@ z@@ am@@ uro .
but he started before he died .
he should have dragged him out and sha@@ king his head .
shit .
well ... I find half the way ...
you would have been happy in any of them .
I &apos;ve been waiting for some time .
come on , I gotta get you out of all your debts .
Yeah , I know how it looks .
Yes , but she was going to Singapore and this statement says Delhi .
we &apos;re coming back .
one more thing . would you mind telling me what in those long boxes of yours ?
I don &apos;t know what that means .
he &apos;s not dead .
guys , no .
who ?
I know what you feel .
in your Mar@@ ines , those who say they will not come looking for you because you have no military value .
crazy man !
- It &apos;s nothing .
son of a bitch !
when you &apos;re ready .
how the hell are we gonna see something ?
sure ?
we now return to the Mel@@ ons of Mel@@ ons ... with Cor@@ ey M@@ aster@@ son &apos;s action .
- Okay , your thing is more fat .
- What has it cost you ?
I know that all this is new for you , but my partner was killed a few days ago , and now one of my old friends has just died .
go on with your light , my heart .
Sum@@ mer , where is your Christmas spirit ?
where do you want to go ?
did you not have this fantasy before ?
and you look happy to be the father of Kri@@ sta and Paul , but you never had time to be mine !
Ar@@ gh !
your search and capture warrant suggests the opposite .
I &apos;m not alone .
don &apos;t wait , it &apos;s not a big problem , but that problem is my name , you know that I find a lot of people who call me Lisa ...
Yes !
are you laughing at your conscience ?
I &apos;m going back now .
look at the right , and it &apos;s N@@ otr@@ e Give me and the Bruce @-@ Louis .
in my campaign for champagne , bottle after bottle , this light
tell me the truth .
I was in Per@@ u .
Yeah , we &apos;re done .
I would not ask for a dollar ... for manu@@ ten@@ tion because I have all the pension money placed on the account , without touching .
promise ...
I &apos;m going to get Graham back in a little ... and his boss .
Oh , my God , look at all this .
F@@ os@@ co@@ lo !
Amy ...
I &apos;m here wrong !
the fire will destroy all evil .
he left a flat .
out .
why ?
but I do not decide whether I will buy it or not .
- Because one day , Joey .
I have the support that I need .
to deprive the world of something so wonderful .
- I must go !
so if you have something to tell me , I suggest you do it , and soon .
last month , when the police started looking for him .
Tony , before An@@ to@@ in@@ ette S@@ aw@@ icki .
he knows as dogs and cigarettes .
before the trial of the edi@@ tion he wrote about poor people ?
you have to help him .
for Lucy .
go and buy some se@@ als , okay ?
I never thought about that .
I &apos;m gonna leave it for today and go to the center .
considering the ... economy .
let me give you a rope , and as@@ phy@@ xi@@ le it .
you &apos;re crazy .
or at least our room .
- Can we talk a moment ?
for a moment I didn &apos;t recognize you .
I &apos;m going to wash my teeth now because I don &apos;t have any insurance either .
no , you had too many things in your life .
I have to sleep in bad position .
I don &apos;t think so .
gentlemen , excuse us .
you want to trust a doctor ?
I know .
- The cars .
- You talk about Mrs White .
come on after neighborhood ?
we made friends .
if that version can be re@@ refu@@ ted we have the right to appeal .
it would be great .
I don &apos;t care if you have to drive all night .
I need to talk to you ...
first strang@@ led the poor Ri@@ gh@@ et@@ to .
- Mr Ro@@ gers .
&quot; the w@@ icked ones and the left faces
do you love your dad much ?
are you interested in a hot water ?
just let me get out of my mind .
if you do , it will be recorded in your background .
but I need to talk to Na@@ omi .
Oliver , while I have someone on the phone , even if I heard , at least one of those fire@@ men is going to die .
- Come home then .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re in the mood saving the planet , but I wanted you to know that the wedding is still standing , and it seems that all the stor@@ ms have been calm .
execu@@ te down through the center of the building .
- I &apos;ll show you .
the D@@ and@@ lin .
- Really ?
- So you have a drink .
Sim@@ mons , I need more ac@@ credi@@ tation to do that .
you say it for your husband ?
I want to see what he tells me .
remember ?
Wow , a mi@@ ld mo@@ ck@@ --
Cameron looked at the sand .
but here things are different and no one wants to spend 24 hours on this planet .
I &apos;ll wait until my own .
- There &apos;s nothing I can do .
that bastard about that , just like you lied above all .
wait a minute .
- Is it married ?
how long have I been asleep ?
please welcome dol@@ ls and Pe@@ que .
... and it &apos;s ass@@ aul@@ ted by a gang gang .
it &apos;s my home .
I &apos;ll take the soc@@ ks is the worst part of every day and it will always be .
I think so much about you .
I have an early turn .
and I know it &apos;s not an excuse , but you were completely wrap@@ ped into work .
they are beyond your al@@ z@@ ance even when you are presented .
I was told to find Lev@@ ander Williams here .
you may not like ... but send your brother out was the right thing .
the gu@@ ts of their legs will bring him to the brain .
many things have happened .
# He died of a fever #
Yeah .
he worked for an Asian country .
no je@@ ans .
you know , this is less than 60 feet .
- If you &apos;re sure we can &apos;t ...
he &apos;s gone crazy .
only that life makes sense .
and you &apos;re a bad driver .
- Where did you get her ?
there !
and I &apos;ve received the worst .
- For fun .
it &apos;s France , Uncle Frank .
here we are .
how happy I am .
good evening , Mr Mor@@ tim@@ er Du@@ er@@ ma
look at you , all re@@ tro .
Yeah ?
they were over for five to one .
agent De@@ ak@@ ins , DE@@ A .
it &apos;s a pity that he didn &apos;t bring a micro@@ scope .
Oh , my God .
you can &apos;t stay here .
suddenly , this man is acting like a real amat@@ eur .
it &apos;s about 18@@ 00 .
you can get out , isn &apos;t it ?
here , what do you think ?
I &apos;ve seen this man a few days ago .
you must stand on the side of your students .
I &apos;m gonna need more credit .
well , fati@@ gue and the total inability to concentrate .
- Hey , I don &apos;t want the loser .
I was last week , but I didn &apos;t find what I was looking for .
Hong Kong , Sh@@ ang@@ hai , Ch@@ un@@ g@@ king ...
Louise , this is gonna sound anor@@ mal , but there was something very important in that bag .
who ?
neither the storm nor ice stopped him .
Yeah , brother John and he always went out together .
you live ?
Ron Sw@@ ans@@ on .
- Okay .
wait .
well , it &apos;s not a good s@@ amar@@ itan Ray .
I &apos;ll take my wallet .
I do not ask for anything .
it &apos;s very quiet .
thank you very much .
I asked you if Mr Gu@@ it@@ on is happy with you .
I can &apos;t bear it !
this kid is yours .
a little after 10 : 00 .
if you do not
everything that has happened , everything that will happen , is subject to laws that are familiar , and with sufficient knowledge , you could literally understand everything .
what a point .
- I want Diana , you know .
- What &apos;s up , baby ?
- Good night .
I still hear that version of &quot; Sem@@ i @-@ Ch@@ ede Life &quot;

how do you know about the Fifth Pro@@ ph@@ et ?
- Yeah , but if not others complain .
what concerns me are the weapons you had .
without an arm , you will keep flo@@ ating on the atmosphere .
Oh my God , it &apos;s pu@@ to@@ centre .
so Maya had to explain to me that an unconditional friend is the only person in your life that , no matter what they say or do , doesn &apos;t matter what they have been through with you , they want you un@@ condi@@ tionally .
- Is it okay ?
Yeah .
more than enough for everyone .
I mean , I &apos;d kill that fucking bastard .
what choice did we have ?
please .
well done .
- And that &apos;s my father .
and Jesse .
I know you love fric@@ tion , okay ?
will you not have any debts again ?
on a desk desk .
it &apos;s time to do it .
okay , okay .
your Honor , we agree that you eat your ashes , it was not part of the last will of Scott .
the queen is high !
and here we go .
and a little pr@@ ayer that if one of us moves up , the other does not have to move outside .
what are you saying ?
shit !
let &apos;s get started , this is gonna be a nasty one .
and when I was talking about her , everything was light .
congratulations .
if we go back to the A@@ A@@ an story , he didn &apos;t care .
son ... if you talk to your dad , tell him I need ... forget it , let me try to speak with him .
you think there was more than that .
I observed the failure of the sto@@ ve and the rapid reaction of my mar@@ ines to meet it .
what do I need ?
no one should have that kind of power at its disposal .
you better talk .
I &apos;m an artist , okay ?
if I wanted them more , I would look ridiculous .
I would sacrifice for her anything in the world .
wait , wait !
insignificant .
we will leave you with a team of cameras to docum@@ entary your adventure , but the world that you knew has been over , and you have a new , new civilisation .
that &apos;s the mark of the White De@@ ert .
but when you &apos;re angry everything makes sense .
I was going to get out of all papers .
it &apos;s like the Roman Empi@@ re .
you &apos;re so parano@@ id .
these are not my brother .
Yeah , we brought Bow@@ man inside .
Yeah ?
Ab@@ ward !
En@@ est@@ eli@@ t , free !
you know , that poor child .
remember this ?
- How ?
Ru@@ fu@@ s , Wy@@ att Logan ,
who the hell are there at 2 : 30 ?
- Is that the Oper@@ ations Centre ?
- Right !
Jesus !
a dog is more mysterious .
what about the store , Steve ?
Hi .
nobody !
tell them to check the safety records and loc@@ ate where they escaped .
someone who worked with me .
it is not often that we are hon@@ ouring ourselves in this town .
that &apos;s right .
well , it was not your fault that you have the right to be excited .
- No .
- What is it ?
I &apos;m sorry , but I &apos;ll make it . - All right , there you are , but while I have to stay in this school with my sister , I don &apos;t think so .
- You have a father always imagin@@ es you coming out of a pu@@ b or born of a ch@@ ac@@ al .
Yes , Mr Er@@ an colleagues in another bar@@ co@@ -- when they put Bun@@ ting .
since today , George Lucas is no longer registered in cinema school .
- Why ?
I just think it &apos;s a little crazy .
of course ...
Victor , this is gonna be very good .
Yeah , well , I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m happy with this ... were you happy , Holly ?
how funny will it be !
look what you &apos;re doing to me .
and we also want the money that Gloria gave you when you sold us .
understand , honey .
don &apos;t let your dog pass you , you go to the dog .
- S@@ ince when ?
I was dark .
you &apos;re very smart .
shouldn &apos;t you be spending your valuable time to make something more significant ?
nonsense !
I still have a dis@@ compensation for the flight .
I feel like a bitch sometimes .
!
how is Mr Pad@@ illa ?
obviously not enough .
Dar@@ yl ... we have to go back and resolve it at home .
let me tell you , Susan , that this is not true .
where is the drink ?
Yes , you are well aware of the J@@ edi style , my colleague .
take my back .
it &apos;s good , but if things go wrong , only a cop can help .
T@@ ash !
it was led to a reception house .
guaranteed your guards give regular up@@ dates on your estimated weapon .
listen to this .
your left , right , your left .
did you see the way you look at Charlie ?
so , after Little Paul was killed and Reg@@ gie would leave it .
but it is wonderful when it happens in the first attempt .
- Are you crazy ?
you didn &apos;t dro@@ wn the white , that &apos;s good .
dude .
here I am .
he got the cake in Merc@@ edes .
finally , we cannot stop observing that there were no people when he died .
let me do nothing fun .

and that &apos;s where one starts making mistakes , right ?
a fi@@ refi@@ p of &quot; The queen co@@ con@@ s . &quot;
okay , stop it , because , you see , you don &apos;t need to be present , Miss Ross .
when you want them to hit them ?

and nights .
but now , five minutes , I still have a great deal of fun .
I am .
lady Anne !

he said , &quot; Don &apos;t worry .
we can neutr@@ alise it with the heat of that work .
what do I do ?
my agent and I .
there may be sexual issues , open conversations on sex , naked sex , strong language , and strong violence , as a 100 mis@@ carri@@ age , a weapon .
right , you do .
the whole task of the whole construction is yours .
I mean ...
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;re here .
Ah .
- To find you .
here , you want your balls ?
do you deny that you give God the creation of something that can no longer exist , such as the vacuum ?
come on , Jamie .
you got it ?
Oh , my God .
two secretari@@ es want to talk to you .
I &apos;ll believe it when I see it .
I knew I wasn &apos;t wrong with you .
you &apos;re wrong about man .

I didn &apos;t want competition to be found before , do you understand ?
let me help you , buddy .
during the super@@ b and the equ@@ ation , these rocks are cap@@ turing the sun in such a way as to light light in different areas of oil .

I hope you don &apos;t give me shit .
you guys who believe in you ?
they closed the five tracks until they can clean them up .
what do you mean , what is it ?
come on , guys , let &apos;s go inside .
what if we have been going on this wrong ?
the heat of the sun has made pred@@ ators leave their hi@@ bern@@ ation .
all that ... glass , and silver .
you and Miss Amy will be ready as soon as we can .
- No , these po@@ ems are really nice .
a mon@@ u@@ ment to the ro@@ yal branches of the V@@ ida .

I don &apos;t know what I would do if I wasn &apos;t Mitch here .
no .
O@@ chan@@ an has a face like this ...
stop shooting and do it .
at first it was more or less me and a bunch of online people who were helping only to make it work .
could you not pretend to be a little disappointed ?
and I did it , I did exactly that .
he started one , and then he had surgery .
you &apos;re here .
is that the man ?
- We have nothing open at 21 .
I would accept your apologies .
- What is he saying ?
I could hear his horse closer , the noise of his cas@@ es in the entrance , his call ...
who the hell are you ?
are we in the same room ?
- There it is .
that would be the good thing for the bad thing ...
this is not something that the Secre@@ t Service can protect you .
- God .
but , damn it !
Mon@@ go has returned !
no , no .
the idea of you together is sick .
his father was very aggressive .
- Did he die ?
Oh @-@ ho @-@ hoo !

was that at the crime scene ?
Yeah , I know .
does this mean that the Be@@ tter A@@ pal is over ?
Hey , guys .

I &apos;ll show you this to my dad when I tell you what they did to me .
I don &apos;t care for your birthday .

Fr@@ yer received a shot .
&quot; in the di@@ stric@@ t of Colu@@ mbi@@ a ,
of course not .
and I fear that this gift is difficult to deliver .
it &apos;s gonna be perfect .
in my way , it is my way to reject the wish of the king of a new London .
I think that the reason why you are upset and everyone is because you are afraid of anything , if you really admit that you are interested in it , you could be disappointed .
he hated animals .
you fuck me !
- Do you always choose the same guy ?
why kill a woman when you can have 4@@ 00,000 £ 4@@ 00,000 ?
we &apos;re talking about all your life !
I really don &apos;t like it .
Hello , Jean .

I ask you not to get near her .

there was no money at half of the renewal .
and I &apos;m sorry I put you in that place .
I &apos;ve done it for years .

For@@ rest@@ er , your turn .

when you need help , when you need to find something ,
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m very sorry , but if it makes you feel better my party night , it took to look at a robot shooting Spi@@ ke for a window so if you want to change .

it is clear that there was a time when this man meant something for you .
it &apos;s just a job with a client .
both agree .
it took it .
maybe you don &apos;t know you were a whore .
I used to be used to you ... and I wondered how a man like W@@ ard Ear@@ p ended with so many good things .
damn it , don &apos;t listen to me .
and he likes it .
Yes , the act receives his name from the lat@@ ine ver@@ bo , which means ...
nobody bought it .
then stop working .
Oh , I think I &apos;ll catch a few more today .
okay , let &apos;s go home .
you must agree with the farmers .
we don &apos;t help anything .
can we expect an explanation in extended version ?

you want to leave it ?
the first moments of my regime are bo@@ iled by those who wanted to steal our freedom .
but who says these things ?

if I can tell you , it was just a powder .
well , well .
take care , I@@ eb@@ an .
- You &apos;re crazy , man !

I mean , I swear I had no idea .
careful !
you always put the other che@@ ek .

I think we must .
come on , quick .
that was pretty good .

I mean ... why ?
I know .
she needed a partner .

it &apos;s a white @-@ Christmas environment .

you can pretend I &apos;m not .
from now on they are going to go down in the scheme .
what is it ?
I know things started wrong between us .
I &apos;m obliged to imagine here .
give it to me .
so think about this :
it &apos;s like I &apos;m getting tired of it , very quick .
and in a sense you can be right .
&quot; more than seven years ago , since this little trou@@ bl@@ esome story came to an end .
attention ... now !
before I forget .
I think I found a way out for us .
- You wouldn &apos;t do that .

they are probably higher points .
so that the place looks more eleg@@ ant .
we need to do something .
do you remember the 300 thousand you owe me ?
we just wanted to know T@@ us tricks .
- Or maybe with a pol@@ y@@ shell ?
- Or insul@@ ted ?
let me ask you this ...
Hi .

that one who over@@ lap J@@ agu@@ ar in the parking field ...
I propose something : we play the cards .
he saved us all .
I understand you want to move away .
just think about it .
&quot; do you want to spend on my dad &apos;s boat ?
some people have to earn life , you know ?

I thought you felt a fucking mother .
- What do you want in return ?
none of us had any ma@@ estr@@ ate in this business .
you &apos;re already thinking about what time you spend while you &apos;re in the water .

I got rid of the Internet .
you have a little must@@ ache .
it feels he &apos;s living in another house .
I mean , if you look at all the other girls here , there is really no contest .
what are you doing , man ?
tell me it &apos;s what you don &apos;t like .
remember those days when I said you were crazy ?
does this mean you want me back ?
we must then agree that my appe@@ ti@@ te is not a real nature , because I give you my word at this time I remember the existence of that hum@@ ble drink .
Ken@@ ai .
Mr. W@@ .@@ W@@ . Be@@ auc@@ ham@@ p .

good day ...
in@@ mobilisation !
Yeah .
I &apos;ll have them in the door in 30 minutes .
- Look at this .
and when you get the ability to see that in yourself , you start seeing that everyone is fighting , every day , and as Fin@@ n said , instead of saying .
- I &apos;m terri@@ fying the Vo@@ y@@ ager on the surface .
come here .
deep @-@ cali@@ ber cali@@ ber
everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
- A couple of days .
where are you going ?

you enjoy it .
why do we pay him ?
no , for fire fire .
detective !
I &apos;m not sure .

we have time to go to Aud@@ u@@ bon Park .
your girl doesn &apos;t like people to refuse in their affairs .
Hello ?
I learned that I have to get very much inside myself , you know , to find a better man , the kids wouldn &apos;t be f@@ lame or scared .
- Great !
we need to make those calls .
I &apos;m looking for it .
how long have they been here ?
why would someone go behind you ?
he has made a porno@@ graphic picture of my suc@@ king .
- A few dates .
and she &apos;s Susan Bun@@ ch .
you haven &apos;t seen how you look at the clock when you talk to you ?
so , or you &apos;re coming to bed or long .
I bet you think , &quot; She is a girl of the East , she &apos;s got a grandma and a mom around you around saying , you &apos;re gonna get a cup of tea ? &quot;
- Bye .
you don &apos;t come , right ?
that &apos;s not a good sign .
it looks like an explosion .
- And I will return your money .
what were you doing then ?
looking for your cell phone in front of the client .
Mad@@ den ?
in no way , your little routine in the champagne room took me into serious trouble .
where do you sleep ?
I hope you &apos;ll enjoy your day .
we felt that we were crazy .
I &apos;m not sure to believe in those things anyway .
you &apos;re the girl in this morning , okay ?
- I missed you today in yo@@ ga .
you have to ... you have to find me in the middle .
it is the guardian of the order and the law .
I don &apos;t know , give him a hug .
- This is your normal turn .
it can &apos;t be known from the outside of these doors .
before we continue to be ready to listen to your conditions .
three letters last year from your sister in England .
that &apos;s the main way .
you &apos;re right .
he hit that tree as if he had been looking for it !
let &apos;s finish with this .
our brains took an hour in loc@@ alising it .
please come back !
no .
are you okay ?
as the good Lord wanted .
miss ?
neither Michael nor Jennifer have g@@ alg@@ os .
come with me .
I have no need for your signature .
I didn &apos;t see him playing .
&#91; knocking the door &#93; Janet , what are you doing here ?
- That color @-@ ray thing , isn &apos;t it ?
I think I &apos;ve never stopped loving her .
Katie !
G@@ u A@@ e Je@@ ong ... forgive me .
I take some pictures .
it takes care of all those who need their help .
I was trying to bring them together in two dimensions .
I &apos;m actually committed ...
tell me what value it has to see and tell you what value it has .
do you welcome that ?
but with those $ 40 , you go there and take a cab .
that is also a crime , Inspector , and more serious .
- I must ask you ... you fell in love with Bur@@ k@@ hardt ?
I come here often .
my mother , always supporting :
if we continue , I &apos;ll need a van .
it must be proud .
you asked me to wait in the hall .
come on , Jack .
he has given the wrong person , Lieutenant .
classic .
Jess told me what he did to his house , as a violent one .
we need to return .
co@@ ward co@@ wards ...
what a nice , but I was going to injec@@ t her in the shoulder .
so it &apos;s gonna be locked forever .
someone has to stop that .
come on .
Oh !
actually , it was never the flower the problem was me trying to accept such as I am , that was all good , I thought about some things you said and if you need to change it .
- But only week@@ ends .
take them .
&quot; stop , vill@@ ain ... &quot;
- Hey !
James , it &apos;s me .
&quot; why did he kill him ?
Lind@@ ant , her@@ pes in the two .
specifically designed for the control of aqu@@ atic veget@@ ation in the channels .
that if it is dedication .
that is very unlikely .
then what ?
I don &apos;t live on the drift !
- Come on .
I think you know what you have to do .
are you my friend , not ?
eat this gr@@ en@@ ade , stupid .
it &apos;s gonna look like a car .
but why didn &apos;t he come to the police ?
your opponents will thank you for a clean death .
heaven warned me about you !
would you mind ?
he died in 19@@ 13 , but his son J.@@ P. Morgan , J@@ r served effectively between 19@@ 15 and 17 , when the United States entered the war .
guys , welcome you .
we had no more than cereal .
- I don &apos;t want to hear it .
do you have the results of the ru@@ g of injury ?
- You &apos;re welcome .
I mean , it &apos;s good , yeah .
what served ?
Eli@@ j@@ ó &apos;s courage .
- No , I haven &apos;t had time .
for what ?
we &apos;re from England .
drunk all day .
I think you won a little bit with the di@@ ap@@ ec@@ on .
- Hi , Au@@ gie .
unfortunately , the subject has suffered a sub@@ dur@@ al hem@@ at@@ oma by excessive mal@@ treatment .
the first time was eight months ago .
but when we shut her down the witch is headed back to the north .
what happened here ?
any questions ?
I@@ r !
- Do you mind ?
it could change the course of history .
- Me too .
if he had done what he came to do , he &apos;d come home .
have you sold secrets to an agent of another country ever ?
- Adam !
- Don &apos;t think more about it , I forgot .
he admi@@ ts him , Inspector .
little fro@@ g we go to the temp@@ le .
♪ You can still realize , as a way ♪
is this often the case ?
&quot; our army will cover the north , while we are under the sea &apos; .
- With a white one .
nothing
I also found fi@@ bres in the victim &apos;s clothes .
I already decided .
- Nothing .
she had a bad run .
- When can you do that ?
you &apos;re gonna love it , guys .
your uncle would be happy to train you .
even the fighting that you have won ... are not true .
you &apos;ve always been nice to me .
I love you , Don .
and ?
that &apos;s not all .
I &apos;m tired of being always lost .
okay .
talking about the bar@@ rels , you know because Gus is not a smo@@ ker ?
I didn &apos;t want to do that .
I &apos;ll take the cher@@ ry juice .
then remember that the devil can always tie you up .
okay , are you ready ?
we don &apos;t start wars !
motherfucker !
sit down , honey ...
and that has a lot of pace .
Yeah .
the sport .
that &apos;ll be great .
I told you that the people couldn &apos;t be completely desert .
- No , there was no one here .
early in the morning , the pal@@ li@@ li@@ t liz@@ ards of the emerging Au@@ tap@@ ies from the ro@@ pes in the rocks where they spend the night and become a heat .
and I wonder ... what does that mean exactly ?
sorry .
uh , but look at this , brother .
how exactly do you want to love freely ?
aren &apos;t you tired of pretending to enter different hours ?
it &apos;s a psy@@ chop@@ ath mother . why are you scared ?
they can &apos;t prevent smoking in the house as I can &apos;t avoid drinking in the car .
see it &apos;s easier to trade .
now .
I think you care about your students .
it was a strange idea , and chose a strange place to share it with the world ... the pool of Stan@@ ford power .
what happened to you ?
they &apos;re in the stable .
the cause of death is cardi@@ genic shock .
I &apos;ll be back several times .
Sally , bring me my coat and my hat .

Yeah .

I am teaching sexu@@ ality in education for health .
- Where &apos;s the cat ?

I doubt it was for my appearance .
no , they hit us in several places at the time .
so ... I &apos;m so sorry .
he &apos;s going to take over the hospital .
now Blair knows the truth , and she and Nate can talk about it .
- And you just lied to me .
look at it .
all security factors have been re@@ built , director .
in my view , you were standing together with the window .
hit her nose .
was that the only evidence that they used in the trial ?
it &apos;s just , like , a hole where I and my cover , we can spend time .
careful now !
sir ?
I should have taken them !
Yeah , he returned to the office .
it &apos;s gonna be cold .

I want to be alone .

the real power of po@@ tion .
honestly , you think I &apos;m a bad bug .
I discovered that the queen belongs to a g@@ our@@ me@@ ts society .
- Agent Ben Wade .
- Yeah , I think so .
nothing is going to change that heart .
if you want to officially reopen the investigation , do it .
okay , we &apos;re fine .
these mistakes are not forgotten .
that &apos;s it .
having that acc@@ ent does not mean that what you say is not stupid .
Mmm , anyway , what did you get ?
days sleeping at dawn of our youth days
Oh , thank God !
the time has come .
you were all right .
and who was the man who took his mother &apos;s life ?
great , here it is .
why should we trust you ?
most of these are guys with problems that seek to pray and violence .
I talked to D@@ any .
Oh , good .
the rebels will listen .
have you identified any of the bodies ?
we &apos;ll tell G@@ aff@@ ney that we did the best .
why would it be ?
with me .
I have to go , it &apos;s dark .
that was after a year .
I mean , they frequ@@ ented , so ...
they won &apos;t find anything dirty in me .
are you kidding ?
I &apos;ve been hearing Shir@@ ley a lot here .

but it &apos;s electric . are you not worried about whether it is being dis@@ solved and the fingers to the table ?
Hello , honey .
I was just doing time , until I was older to leave it .
let &apos;s go .
he told me : &quot; I &apos;m gonna try . &quot;
we can &apos;t have another child now .
I appreciate that you try to encourage me .
come on , up , treasure .
I got it !
it &apos;s very good to be back .
if we can &apos;t be ourselves , why are we going to marry ?
you shouldn &apos;t have prevented me .
no , there must be some kind of mistake .
- Go home and bring something .
- Bravo !
your health .
I know what you need .
- So why will we need good will ?

Yes !
I didn &apos;t hear anything .
how hard .
you think so .
bail is set in the sum of $ 20 000 .
I can &apos;t believe he &apos;s gone .
no one could know that he wasn &apos;t the chef that was behind the restaurant , behind Che@@ f Hol@@ den .
- Good .
really ?
thank you , Dr. Brown , it &apos;s the one who brought you .
why ?
you have to go back and point .

- Okay .
Yeah , when he was married to Ch@@ er .
- Thank you .
believe me , you don &apos;t want to be judged as an adult .
- Yes , male .
I don &apos;t know what the hell I &apos;m gonna do now .
let me decide what to do .
well , if I can &apos;t say &quot; love &apos; , you can &apos;t say &apos; feelings &apos; .
would you walk around ?
- So you went home and were alone ?

- Thank you , dear .
you &apos;re good !
it depends .
what ?
they &apos;d think I &apos;m an idiot .
I was going to do it , but then I thought , what would happen if , let us say a relative , decided in a desert war@@ ehouse ?
- A drink , a drink .
nothing .
because he loves this room , listening to his voice and saving the day .
and , indeed , there is no corner .
I never gave you an incentive to stop .
no .
Mrs I@@ ac@@ ob !
why ?
Yeah .
it was your father .
I &apos;m an astro@@ car@@ ot@@ graph , and I was making a star map when I suddenly attacked my ship .
no danger .
what did Ho@@ y@@ t say you can &apos;t tell me ?
thank you not .
let &apos;s have fun .
- Yeah .
you hear !
for a long time .
shut up .
they think they are the protec@@ tors of humanity .
the next day , we ran away from dawn ...
let me ...
mistakes are made .
are you really gonna do this ?
- Not yet , no .
you understand what I &apos;m saying ?
I abused him .
if I had to summarise it in a word , I would say Mickey .
I mean , how are you going out of the building ?
- Holy shit !
it will not be able to participate more in the contest because it is moving in school .
I &apos;m a dirty dog .
sheriff Re@@ yes .
will I see you in a week ?
Sha@@ ggy :
damn , I &apos;m taking my car !
the court will meet tomorrow at midnight .
I feel that I am in the un@@ familiar Dimension .
I mean , you &apos;re making self @-@ stop .
I should have mentioned that the patient is a doctor .
it makes people feel comfortable .
I raped the most sacred trust between a doctor and his patient .
you look for the wid@@ el , the ver@@ ge or the ass .
every time I find that , I &apos;m in peace for a while .
- Let &apos;s sell it !
I just want to talk to you before .
the med@@ als that had won , letters from your old colleagues .
- You &apos;re wrong , D@@ ot@@ com !
I still did not , but I can stop when you want .
come on , come on !
please calm down and tell me what you &apos;re talking about .
wait a minute ...
two days of suspension to give you a kick in the eggs .
I realized your feelings of your de@@ pression , more than anything , and I think I realized that she had more and more diseases , in terms of the loss of his voice ,
again working late ?
88 less !
sorry ...
Inspector D@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ... will lead the next attempt
always and when I don &apos;t have to do with Lincoln Bur@@ ro@@ ws !
he won &apos;t pretend to convince me that he was his life at stake .
for your age ?
give it to me .
it is easy to discourage the gap .
- Hey !
how high are they now ?
don &apos;t move !
she brought me to a friend .
hurt ?
so it &apos;s a good vampi@@ re .
you just said the war .
why ?
and worse still , it almost explo@@ ded Spi@@ ke .
everyone has a fever , breathing hard , pain in the chest and stuff .
business is in boom , as you can see .
I &apos;m Car@@ son Dal@@ y .
to the point of blind@@ ness and paraly@@ sis ?
Lord C@@ e@@ cil was stab@@ bed only once !
small ones ?
terrorists need funding .
I wouldn &apos;t have had to hide what I am .
I do .

thank you .
what did he do ?
well , that was the last time you play po@@ ker with you .
Yeah .

Nathan , get out of the middle !
Dr. A@@ den ?

around two billion dollars .
there &apos;s no escape !
and I asked you to throw the chain after or@@ dering .
and I don &apos;t even know if I &apos;m black with white stri@@ pes or white stri@@ ps .
nobody considered my suggestions !
but I didn &apos;t say the order to end the S@@ pal@@ don@@ i family .
to the question : &quot; the defend@@ ant has a flu@@ id flow ? &quot;
honestly , we understand .
and he said that if he doesn &apos;t take it , he &apos;s probably blind .
Yeah , it &apos;s gonna explo@@ de !
go to town and try to get to Cur@@ ly Bill .
we don &apos;t know .
now you &apos;re the one who sends .
but the cheese ... who knew that the sky could come from a cow ?
- Chan@@ ta@@ je .

- Wait a minute .
we can &apos;t leave C@@ am out of this .
- Is it not yet ?
a yard .
guys , I &apos;m gonna steal the fr@@ idge .
I hope you will see us again in better circumstances .
come on , how did you approve two years ?
did you ... just ?
the shield !
I think so .
don &apos;t be shy .
come on , man !
she buried his dreams and I sold my soul to that business ... so that we can give you the things we did not have .
then the Chinese pay five , ten times the cost .
I did tea , we walk a while then we left the single storm to see the storm and the rest already knows .
I &apos;ve got T@@ hap@@ ar cas@@ inos for a win and don &apos;t give me the game of cards .

- Hi .
you have to put foot in your chest .
do you mind if I accompany them ?

I &apos;m not hungry .
you can only sell your death .
- My friends .
that was the last time you saw her .
- Come on !
honestly ?
Yeah .
- What was that ?
he had a family at that time and I wanted him to be well for his other son , Lucas .
he works fast , I still have a great deal to send .
- There you go .
V@@ ad@@ im was close to the scene . what were you doing in the Queen &apos;s quarters ?
- Yes !

don &apos;t you recognize your own daughter ?
what does it mean ?
I just par@@ ked on the road .
Hi .
don &apos;t play well with others .
no !
I don &apos;t know .
just what is needed for Christians to turn them into their pur@@ g@@ atory .
now I believe that the pri@@ ners or che@@ er@@ ers ... as they are called ... are the worst people in the world .
well , listen .
- I know .
it may not work , but you have to learn and grow .
shit .
excuse me ?
I should go ...
one once and to die once ...
I &apos;m just trying to be your friend .
they trusted him .
no .
I &apos;m sorry , buddy .

no , sir .
the external part of these suits was designed to attract and fun to the assistants to conventions and their families while reminding them what corpor@@ ation they were representing .
how yesterday ?
if you talk to them , your colleagues ,
Aah ... could it be ?
I decide who goes with me , and it &apos;s Pen@@ ny , not you !
Rud@@ y Hol@@ lings has been in Spain a year .
thank you .
that &apos;s what he shot .
stop it !
no dance .
no , you &apos;re a man of a single talent , French .

Yeah , I know .
I &apos;m gonna have to go find her .
detective Super@@ inten@@ dent ?
♪ All right , I smoke that bomb ♪
it &apos;s so that the cor@@ k doesn &apos;t get away , so when you get it , get out , you know ?
the sca@@ va will be killed .
- About what ?
- They have followed .
it is a terrible place , almost no veget@@ ation , but at least this girl in the north and Mr Su@@ re@@ ño we succeeded in doing quite well .
it was a fool .
tell me , Megan is interested for you ?
I don &apos;t care .
- At least she &apos;s out of danger .
you &apos;re starting to believe in your own fic@@ tion .
have you told me you look like James Taylor ?
I have to spend my stages of impulse .
- Old !
&quot; have to love anyone , whatever but never love &apos; .
because it was a child &apos;s son , you see .
thank you for your help .
I &apos;m sorry .
Yeah ?
do I have the little head ?
we &apos;re fine .
sit down .
no , honey , I think you &apos;re addic@@ ted to win .

what &apos;s going on ?
- N@@ ever@@ a .
- You &apos;re charming .
what happened ?
Simon ?
a communications unit of our ship .
it is an integral part of our team .
- What do you think ?
it &apos;s your dad .
Y@@ om@@ o@@ gi ?
please respect the area of non @-@ smo@@ kers .
not like this .
maybe because killing a bunch of boys is not big enough for someone who murdered a pregnant woman ?
- Me too ?
dear Elizabeth , your new life as my consor@@ te is perfect .
inspection , I hear sounds of sin .
I will try but Mar@@ g@@ aux is well kept .
would you be able to help them ?
- What do you think ?
- No , honey .
and they will be thrown out of im@@ moral .
where are they ?
Duncan !
good to see you !
you can only be in something there , cup .
I &apos;m going out again .
that will not improve the age .
and then we &apos;ll get it from the Cl@@ an .
because they look at the same agenda after day , and we are sitting here , without doing anything ... scratch the tail , as mon@@ keys .
why don &apos;t you give me a hand ?
that is not true , and I think that Pen@@ e@@ try Chris is also one .
your shoulder to your fingers .
you know , what &apos;s going on ?
none of what he said suggests that &quot; mass &quot;
these walls are their only protection .
he &apos;s lucky he has a hurry .
how &apos;s the boy ?
because we want us to know that we are grateful , too .
it doesn &apos;t fit here .
is it enough ?
of course .
in full ?
it &apos;s cold now .
see this face ?
SLIM Mo@@ sel@@ ey is next .
bad surprises .
Hey !

Captain of the Nav@@ y .
so what do you think ?
you &apos;re much worse .
Yeah , I &apos;m a little bit like that .
this is a cheque for all the dirty money you used to control me and watch out without my consent .
I hope that I can do it with love and the support of your family .
