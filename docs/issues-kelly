Issues to Resolve:
Readability scorers are affected by tokenization. OPUS/Europarl data comes 
	pre-tokenized (splitting "Kelly' s", for instance). This affects 
	scoring. We need to think about how to deal with this (and if it 
	matters - especially b/c OPUS has many more apostrophes than Europarl,
	and splitting tends to make readability scores lower. 
There may be a bug in textstat.text_standard. Its scores are sometimes 
	severely inconsistent w/ Flesch/Dale.
We need a dev/test set for OpenSubtitles
Readability scorers break with unexpected unicode characters. Decide how to
	deal with this. (delete unicode, change to |, etc)

11-Nov: Currently downloading OpenSubtitles2018 -- must do data preprocessing 
	again with this when it's downloaded
