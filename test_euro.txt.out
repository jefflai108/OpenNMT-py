a Re@@ public@@ an strategy to prevent Obama &apos;s choice .
the Re@@ public@@ ans confirmed their policy for the need to fight the electoral fraud .
now , the Bren@@ nan C@@ enter consider this last one and claims that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of a li@@ ght@@ ning .
in fact , Re@@ public@@ ans didn &apos;t find more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the States in ten years .
one thing is true , those new provisions will affect the rate of participation .
in that sense , these mining measures will part in part the American democratic system .
contrary to what happens in Canada , American states are responsible for the federal elections in the United States .
and in that same line a majority of American governments introduced , from 2009 , from 2009 , new laws that would make the process of registration or vote .
this phenomenon has spread after November 2010 &apos;s elections , which saw the increase of 6@@ 75 Re@@ public@@ ans in 26 states .
therefore , during the year 2011 was introduced 180 law projects that would limit the exercise of the vote in 41 states .
the new electoral laws require the voters to present an identity document with a photo , besides a American citizenship .
by other way , those laws reduce the pre @-@ emp@@ tional vote , over@@ stand the right to entry as a choice in the day of the trial and withdraw their right to the vote to citizens .
before the 2006 elections , no American demands that the voters will present an identity document with photo@@ graphy .
State Indi@@ ana was the first to demand it .
the United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitu@@ tionality of Indi@@ ana Law .
that &apos;s why the Re@@ public@@ ans were rus@@ hed to extend that practice to other states .
in the last few years these authorities have supported law projects in 34 states to force the voters to introduce a film document with photo@@ graphs .
it &apos;s important to realize that , contrary to what happens in Que@@ bec , the American citizens don &apos;t have a universal identity document , like the social security card .
in fact , a 11 % of American citizens , I mean 21 million people in voting , they don &apos;t count with any I@@ .D. with photo@@ graphy .
by the way , five million new voters in 2012 have no identity document with those characteristics .
but , often , the recei@@ pt of the ID document costs more than $ 100 .
which , the new restrictions affecting young people , minorities and people with low income .
in fact , a 25 % of the Americans , 15 % of people who earn less than 3@@ 5,000 per year , a 18 % of the citizens of 65 and 20 % of the voters within 65 and 29 years .
and there &apos;s still more .
in a lot of states , students , the voters who are voting to the Democrats , they can &apos;t use the identity with photo@@ graphy .
by other way , those same states authori@@ zing the members of the fishing clubs or the hun@@ ters that are supposed to vote the Re@@ public@@ ans to use the Re@@ public@@ ans .
before 2004 , I was not required to vote the public to vote .
Ari@@ zona was the first state to present that demand .
since 2011 , a dozen states has adopted laws that require the voters to prove that they are American citizens .
those measures seek , clearly , limit the fai@@ ry vote .
it seems to be two of each three elec@@ tors .
by the way , the Re@@ public@@ ans Re@@ public@@ ans backed up in 2011 certain laws that they ab@@ ol@@ ed the selection of elec@@ tors at eight states .
besides , they just kept the right of people and the groups to create a help service to the voters who wanted to set up .
these restrictions have consequences .
for example , in 2004 General &apos;s general elections , the officers of the elec@@ tions helped the registration of approximately 10 million citizens .
the measures adopted since 2009 managed to get the collection of new voters down in 2010 compared to the year 2006 .
besides , Re@@ public@@ ans issued laws in other five states that they preferred the reduction of the vote for advance .
for example , in the 2008 elections in Florida , a hundred % of the elec@@ tors who voted for advance were American , while these last two weren &apos;t more than 13 % of the state of the state .
in the case of the h@@ is@@ p@@ ans , the same thing would happen .
these don &apos;t represent more than 11 % of the elec@@ tors , which means to a 24 % of the citizens .
however , white men , who represent 76 % of the electorate , they don &apos;t represent more than 46 % of the citizens .
of course , the Democrats and their supporters are opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the selection of elec@@ tor .
in this sense , the federal rul@@ ers have blocked several laws of law .
the United States Department of the United States mentioned to suspend the most controversial laws .
he could , partly limit the damage .
for example , so 16 of 34 states adopted the law that demanded the presentation of a ID document .
however , it &apos;s undeniable that the new rules will complic@@ se the exercise to vote in 2012 .
critics reported the end of the laws that have been voted , since it &apos;s clear that with them to influence 2012 &apos;s results in key states .
a report from the Bren@@ nan C@@ enter shows that the states that have adopted those laws represent 17@@ 1 of the 2@@ 70 votes necessary in the elections to achieve the presidency .
it &apos;s too early to claim with certainty if these legislative modifications to the scale of electoral system will have a significant impact on the presidential election results .
one thing is true , those new provisions will affect the rate of participation .
in this sense , the mining measures will part in part the American democratic system .
is he , uh , drinking cancer test , does it turn or do it ?
in fact , P@@ SA &apos;s test presents , occasionally , wrong results , with false results or even false results , after the ones who decide to act useless medical interventions .
it &apos;s a bit more than enough to make doubts about men , you &apos;re disappointed in whether you should do or not the detection tests .
do the test or not ?
we &apos;ve asked for two specialists .
in studies in the United States he detected a great infection of infec@@ tions between the shows of sample , so it &apos;s hard to interpret those data and make recommendations firm .
by the way , the European study showed some kind of mortality between patients who had the detection and the ones who didn &apos;t .
the studio , with a follow @-@ up to 12 years , proved also that it exists between 30 and 40 % of chances of scar@@ ing me@@ st@@ asis if the detection test has been taken .
I recommend , therefore , test from the 50 years , or from the 40 years if your father has suffered spon@@ sor cancer .
American origin men have a higher risk rate .
key is to take a good decision once detected cancer .
there &apos;s an aggressive s@@ quir@@ ter and other me@@ ds that they are ind@@ ol@@ y .
it &apos;s really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of their cancer .
today a lot of men who have detected a cancer is not treated , since he said cancer isn &apos;t aggressive or a risk for their life .
in your place we suggested an active surveillance of illness and , if this progress , we offer them a treatment .
we determine each time with more precise criteria to decide who should or not be treated .
I recommend you do the test in any case .
but it &apos;s important to talk to your doctor to determine if you should be done or not .
mo@@ b has created , in collaboration with the American Society of U@@ ro@@ logy , a tool that allows to evaluate the pr@@ os and the pass@@ s of P@@ SA tests .

prevent disease .
unfortunately , there &apos;s no miracle recipe to prevent cancer .
despite progress of research , the adoption of healthy life habits are still the best way to reduce the risks of suffering .
we think that if everyone ate well and moved enough , they could prevent a 30 % of the car@@ ts .
&quot; if nobody smo@@ ked , that rate would raise , at least 50 % , &quot; underlines André Beau@@ li@@ eu , &quot; the Indian Society &apos;s name against C@@ ang@@ er . &quot;
instead , we analy@@ zed that around 10 % of the car@@ ts are her@@ edi@@ ts .
many others are still totally inexplic@@ able .
for the Canadian Society against C@@ ang@@ er , the fight against the tobacco is still a priority to spite of the number of smoking number .
tobacco is linked with 85 % of cancer cases .
it &apos;s , besides , a risk factor for other types .
it hurts the health of people .
&quot; today for today , there &apos;s still 1.5 million smo@@ kers in Que@@ bec &quot; declared the k@@ ingdom André Beau@@ li@@ eu .
a case waiting for 10 years after I quit smoking , the risk of dying cancer .
the weight
the fat thing and obesity support the appearance of illness , according to C@@ C@@ C. .
increase cancer &apos;s cancer risks , on top and straight , of s@@ lav@@ y , p@@ ad and ma@@ ker .
&quot; research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout life protects breast cancer , add . &quot;
the food .
the organis@@ m recommended , too , limit the car@@ nes .
in big amounts , they make the risk of suffering a color cancer .
the bac@@ try products must also be avoided .
the preservation of meat for their own , dr@@ in@@ ning or ski@@ p , can cause the formation of can@@ ine substances .
&quot; you can damage the bodies of the organis@@ m and bring the cancer to cancer , &quot; explain .
the vitamin@@ s
in the last few years , several scientists have studied the connections between the complex vit@@ am@@ ics and cancer .
however , for the moment their investigations are not conclu@@ sive .
the S@@ C@@ C , the studies about vit@@ am@@ ine E are contradictory .
while in one of them , one of them came up with a blood risk of pro@@ state , in another what was observed , rather , a raise .
the effect of the D D in cancer has not been able to determine clearly .
otherwise , M. Beau@@ li@@ eu insists on the importance of talking about the concerns and family records of each one with their doctor .
&quot; making the test test doesn &apos;t get cancer . &quot;
Hig@@ gs &apos;s .
the announcement of the el@@ der of Hig@@ gs gener@@ ated a great con@@ motion last summer , and right .
he believes , actually , that this guy is involved in the body responsible for everything that exists in the universe , nothing more and nothing less .
and what &apos;s more , it &apos;s about the par@@ ticle whose existence said the standard model , our best or less bad explanation of nature , which has yet been observed .
but for physi@@ cs it &apos;s not entirely clear that you treat Hig@@ gs .
we know without a doubt that there is a new match and it looks like a lot to Hig@@ gs pre@@ said for the standard model .
besides , new de@@ vel@@ ted data this week in a major of physi@@ cs .
anyway , let &apos;s assume this is Hig@@ gs , because the chances of mistake seem to be a little bit .
there is , in this big world , a general and empty law which means that two things can &apos;t be found at the same place at the same time .
there &apos;s no way to break that rule and I don &apos;t try too much , because it &apos;ll end damage .
even though the physi@@ cs of par@@ ticles is a very complex world , he has shown that there is also a law of these characteristics :
classified physi@@ cs in two categories .
by one part we found the good citizens called fer@@ mi@@ ons , who obey themselves at the beginning of Pau@@ li .
and for another they &apos;re the gu@@ ts , a p@@ anda p@@ anda that he doesn &apos;t have respect for anything , or at least not for this beginning , which means they can find themselves in the same place and at the same time .
according to the Web site , The Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey Ad@@ venture Ad@@ venture , by the way , is extraordinary , the gu@@ ts are apart in two groups , and the par@@ ticles of force , which we &apos;re not going to be here , and the &quot; force par@@ ticles &quot; in which the great forces of nature will be spread in , and &quot; force @-@ in @-@ law , &quot; which the great forces of nature will be spread in .
these gu@@ ts , it would seem to stress here , not the ex@@ ich@@ es we could believe .
in fact , if you get read this cr@@ ague , it &apos;s thank a very highly ban@@ ker .
in fact , when a match with an electric burden speed or change direction , &quot; dis@@ order the electro@@ magnetic field in that precise environment , a little like when we launch a stone . &quot;
in this &quot; dis@@ order , &quot; an electro@@ magnetic wave .
more stable field
it happens the same thing with Hig@@ gs &apos;s , with the difference that it &apos;s about another field , the Hig@@ gs field , which needs to be &quot; un@@ ordered &quot; to make this mess .
now , the Hig@@ gs field is so much more stable than the electro@@ magnetic field .
that &apos;s why there &apos;s a huge par@@ ticle acceler@@ ator like C@@ ad@@ N &apos;s .
the an@@ alo@@ gy with the magnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Hig@@ gs and mass .
in fact , not all the par@@ ticles and all the materials inter@@ act with the magnetic field .
some , like the im@@ ric@@ ans , do it , but others don &apos;t ... a piece of paper , for example , it won &apos;t be by itself .
and the same way , not all the par@@ ticles act with Hig@@ gs &apos;s field , which makes it a mass , while the rest of the world , by the way ...
now , what can you say &quot; all those investigations ? &quot;
for science , this serves to verify the validity of the standard model .
for your part , many people want to be very heavy , so the lesser difference could open a door to a new physi@@ cs that reg@@ als certain holes in the model .
this has to say , he &apos;s still huge , like he doesn &apos;t propose any explanation to gravity .
but we didn &apos;t find such differences in C@@ Car@@ N until the moment .
repercussions .
the effects of these investigations in our day are hard to predict , but we don &apos;t think we &apos;re wrong to say that you will have no .
to see :
they kept the scientific applications , but nothing else .
in fact , as you said the Wil@@ lard Bo@@ yle , you worked in the B@@ ell team , where you invented the las@@ er in 19@@ 60 , and that drew the first las@@ er .
imagine ...
and besides , applications can also proceed to the entire device surrounding the investigation .
for example , the same Wil@@ lard Bo@@ yle drew a light of light in 196@@ 9 in the course of your op@@ tical investigation .
even though he wasn &apos;t at all his original intention , this chap@@ ker@@ ator is right now .
that doesn &apos;t mean , of course , the L@@ H@@ C. activities would necessarily turn our lives , but never know ...
the best way to die ...
in your Committee Mor@@ ir in dignity , Que@@ bec recently discussed the delicate matter of life .
the debate must be re@@ taken soon while a bill is ready .
now , in that essential domain , there &apos;s still much to do .
Dev@@ o@@ ir has tried to see him .
a few weeks ago , Mr. L@@ .
pro@@ state cancer that I was destroying him had a break of two years .
&quot; I &apos;ve been given five years of life , but I &apos;ve already had seven &quot; , &quot; rel@@ axed , made it up to your bed in the front of the Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ l .
&quot; but it &apos;s always a shock , we can &apos;t be prepared for this , &quot; continues .
the disease has caused him , a huge weakness that prevents him from going alone to the bathroom and even eating by himself .
sitting in front of a p@@ enci@@ le , accept that he helps to eat .
brave , he &apos;s even smi@@ led up , talking to the dis@@ acqua@@ int@@ ers , and he &apos;s got a bath .
the courage of ordinary death .
&quot; my greatest wish is to tell me the di@@ arr@@ a , it &apos;s humili@@ ating . &quot;
a few hours later , the team found a remedy to that evil .
&quot; in the course of our lives learn that a man is standing standing , &quot; rel@@ in@@ ning Pierre Bro@@ de@@ ur , psycho@@ log@@ ist in the Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is .
back to your childhood , for certain people , it &apos;s an unacceptable humili@@ ation .

because , according to the opinion of most people you work in hand@@ mental care , the big moments have place in the heart of that return .
all the patients who enter the pal@@ e center Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is suffer cancer .
they have a maximum @-@ lifetime life @-@ life forecast .
in that state , the team of doctors and nurses who are around , they don &apos;t offer the heal@@ ers .
the biggest fear of Mrs. A. , 89 years , is to die &quot; conscious and drow@@ ned . &quot;
but the disease has found her kids .
&quot; I have good kids , add .
&quot; I &apos;m not more wish in this life , &quot; says , before I accept that a mass@@ age to help you breathe .
and wait , in the next few days , a last visit of your son who lives in Italy .
in Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is offers , with a group of volunteers , watch of body and help for food .
it &apos;s hand@@ mental care they give you when nothing can be done .
to help your death be more comfortable .
in Que@@ bec we &apos;re counting on a board of nutri@@ tional care for each other .
it &apos;s too little , since we know we &apos;re all gonna die someday .
here , life continues in the best possible conditions , explain Dr. Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , one of the doctors in the center .
now be a level of physical comfort , emotional or spiritual .
the mor@@ i@@ bun@@ do is offering his mouth with br@@ andy or Pep@@ si , according to the law@@ suit .
the diab@@ e@@ tics are not controlling their sugar rates .
death is part of the day .
last night we served a beer to Mr. X , who died in the course of night .
this morning , your son is over beer at the la@@ und@@ ry .
&quot; we helped both patients like their loved ones , &quot; rel@@ axed N@@ ath@@ alie Sav@@ ard , Director of the care .
in the Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is days .
by the way of a 94 @-@ year @-@ old man that you know your last family meeting in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , well placed between their pil@@ lows while everyone &apos;s drinking their health , a young woman in 36 @-@ year @-@ old , surrounded by their parents , his wife and two kids , after you tried to survive .
&quot; since six months , there &apos;s always three to five be@@ ts . &quot;
a 53 % of the patients who are admitted in the Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is@@ arri@@ ño is coming from their house and a 47 % hospital .
problem of access to operational care
a 77 % of the Canadian is simply not access to the me@@ als , I mean , to the atten@@ d@@ ings to relieve the suffering when a sick man comes into the terminal of his life , be in his home , in the hospital or in a care centre .
and several organisms , like the Victor @-@ G@@ ad@@ bo@@ is , and the media society to the Grand Mon@@ tr@@ idge , speci@@ aliz@@ ing almost exclusively in the care of patients with cancer .
it &apos;s precisely that big deal in Que@@ bec &apos;s health care , which makes a lot of medical doctors working out the adoption of a law that rules the eu@@ than@@ asia and suicide .
since October , a manif@@ est signed by emin@@ tional care , like Dr. Bal@@ four Moun@@ t and Dr. Bernard L@@ apo@@ in@@ te and Dr. Bernard L@@ apo@@ in@@ te .
according to Dr. Christi@@ ane Mar@@ tel , the health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone have a right to quality care before you accept the eu@@ than@@ asia .
&quot; recently , &quot; rel@@ axed , &quot; I &apos;ve seen a patient to spend 14 days in Ur@@ g@@ ences in Ur@@ g@@ ency . &quot;
I &apos;m afraid the patients wish to die alone because they don &apos;t get the right care . &quot;
and in parallel , many can@@ alo@@ logi@@ sts are stubborn with their patients until the last day , despite the worst predic@@ tions .
the hope of H@@ ram@@ è@@ ne &apos;s survival of H@@ return was under minimum when he left a contain@@ er treatment .
&quot; when I told my body that I wanted to stop the treatment , she told me that I was too sorry to stop fighting , &quot; rel@@ axed .
&quot; however , she told me there was nothing more than to do ! &quot;
there &apos;s no respect .
Dr. Mar@@ tel thinks that a 90 % of the sick people who are asking to die to their wives that they didn &apos;t take care of their pa@@ int@@ ers once in their demands .
but we have to say the pal@@ e &apos;s not absolutely al@@ mighty in what matters the treatment of pain .
according to El@@ sie Mon@@ er@@ eau , Director of the Super@@ inten@@ tional care to Grand Mon@@ tr@@ idge , the patients don &apos;t answer the treatment against the pain in a 8 % of cases .
at the end of life , doctors usually use the pal@@ e se@@ d@@ ation , which serves to sleep the patient until at the moment of their de@@ function , whether it &apos;s a s@@ por@@ ter or permanently .
we can &apos;t pretend that we don &apos;t understand that part of the suffering .
every time , the disease is not reliev@@ ed .
the sick people are not reliev@@ ed all the same , &quot; I love to die . &quot;
but that doesn &apos;t necessarily mean &quot; I want the eu@@ than@@ asia &quot; but &quot; I want you to reliev@@ ed me . &quot;
the completion of this report has been possible thank you .

&quot; it turns out how funny the system is . &quot;
he led the scandal in 2011 , that was possible to thank an investigation in the bottom of the out@@ laws in Que@@ bec , which the Prime Minister of that moment , Jean Char@@ est had no more sense than to delay .
the Duc@@ ning@@ ne@@ au report established a direct bond between the industry , the underground funding of parties and corruption between officials .
&quot; since the beginning of the investigation in 2010 , so just the Ministry of transport would have saved $ 1,000 million in contracts , con@@ having some of their inst@@ inc@@ ts with a proportional part . &quot;
the Char@@ bon@@ ne@@ au Commission has already fallen down two war@@ ners , add , while he expects to be able to reach the existing arts behind individuals . &quot;

permanent an@@ tic@@ or@@ rup@@ tion unit , created in 2011 , applies as well with your inter@@ domin@@ ators team , investig@@ ators and government .
this unit is also working in addition to the police of the Mar@@ te@@ au squ@@ ad , which , since 2009 , they have made the war@@ ehouse of the war@@ ri@@ de of Montreal .
these last few weeks , the unit has run into the seri@@ al records of fraud and corruption against municipal charges like Frank Z@@ amp@@ ino and Richard Mar@@ co@@ t@@ te , mayor of a city of yours .
next of the list would be Gil@@ les V@@ ai@@ ll@@ anc@@ our@@ our@@ t , that he just resig@@ ned from his mayor of Lav@@ al , third city of Que@@ bec .
he suspected that he &apos;s been mess@@ ed up in exchange for public contracts .

this last has caused con@@ cu@@ sion to explain the commission of public contracts .

in Montreal , the &quot; system &quot; works with efficiency .

other network officials have admitted that they received money for inf@@ ating the bills between a 30 % and 40 % in false ex@@ after .
besides , a match of the mayor &apos;s game , Martin Du@@ mont , he accused M. Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay of being the most un@@ explained view to a parallel budget and filled with their dirty money .
in front of these revel@@ ations , M. Tre@@ m@@ bl@@ ay resig@@ ned at the beginning of November and took Montreal a huge crisis .
Ch@@ ant@@ al Rou@@ le@@ au was one of Montreal &apos;s first choice policies .
like mayor of Ri@@ vi@@ ère @-@ D@@ ra@@ i@@ ries @-@ P@@ ra@@ i@@ ries , in the east of the island , he heard from 2010 to the sale of a municipal land for five million dollars and sold by 1.@@ 6 million .

of the investigation that will finally be carried out , she ensures that he thro@@ ws out of a thre@@ ad to understand the functioning of the system , under@@ loaded by the s@@ can , to stop the winner and fishing to the guilty . &quot;
and add that the process is &quot; painful , but positive . &quot;
we &apos;re cleaning up the wounds but I would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very alert to doubt that the dubious practices don &apos;t repeat .
how to do cleaning .
regularly .
Jacques Duc@@ ning@@ ne@@ au , for his part , he claims that &quot; The officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars , but he &apos;s rest@@ less about most of the &quot; elected politicians &quot; role .
I estimate in a 70 % percentage of dirty money that used to go to the investigation of electoral campaigns in Que@@ bec , ir@@ on@@ ine :
the government is proposing to limit 100 bucks to parties , but that won &apos;t change donation , according to him , &quot; as long as they don &apos;t strictly tell the electoral expenses , there will be dirty money in politics . &quot;
he ple@@ ases a complete review of the public contract of the public contract and funding parties : &quot; we can &apos;t fall under the way , go to the bottom of things , with courage , will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid bases , more controls and laws . &quot;
if this story sp@@ its the international image of Que@@ bec and Montreal , M. Duc@@ ning@@ ne@@ au invit@@ es those who would look at the mirror .
&quot; the P@@ S@@ G &apos;s not the F@@ C Barcelona ! &quot;
this season has acquired a new entity with P@@ S@@ G .
how would you explain that advance ?
you could explain for a personal conscience , but also the new dimension of P@@ S@@ G .
they &apos;ve got big players .
I &apos;m on day on your side .
the tech@@ nici@@ an &apos;s also brought me a lot .
and those elements push me to raise the level of my game .
in a game , that &apos;s easier .
it &apos;s all too fast at football .
but I don &apos;t love me .
since my begin@@ nings in the IN@@ F Cl@@ ai@@ re@@ fon@@ ze center to my step by Saint @-@ E@@ aron , I &apos;ve always advanced advanced steps .
he &apos;s gonna get the benefit of competition by C@@ arlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti .
the recru@@ ited of this summer is used to putting up very high @-@ level parties .
they know that every training is crucial .
that makes a player like me like to fight and give it everything .
for another part , C@@ arlo An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti gives me a lot as to my posi@@ tioning .
he &apos;s backed up as Claude M@@ ak@@ el@@ ele , who played at the same position as me .
are you the man who needed the team ?
of course .
An@@ cel@@ ot@@ ti inspired all the tech@@ nici@@ ans .
today today , there &apos;s nobody else in the League and it &apos;s between the best European train@@ ers .
he has a great experience and he won numerous tit@@ les with best clubs .
he &apos;s worked with big players .
I think he &apos;ll take another tit@@ les in Paris .
in January I had a very comfor@@ ting conversation with him .
I just walked out of a series of injuries .
confidence in me explains my good performance .
what do you think about the P@@ S@@ G in the first part of the season ?
in the League 1 , Lyon has taken off the leader of leader .
but we keep in the emb@@ ap .
one of our greatest goals is the champion of the champi@@ ons , we &apos;ve classified to the eigh@@ th @-@ style .
what &apos;s the target of the club in this competition ?
let &apos;s try to get it as far as possible .
from now on , anything can happen .
but we have much to say in front of a lot of good European teams .
we want , to start , finish the first of our li@@ ga in front of the O@@ ony can be able to get the back of eigh@@ th .
the P@@ S@@ G can become a great European club .
you have the budget ...
to become a great European club , Paris has to win and be there long .
today , that &apos;s not the case .
at economic level , P@@ S@@ G &apos;s delivered to their means that that project is taken .
don &apos;t get the drink in the League , like last season , would it be a big failure ?
of course , it would be a great disappointment .
this year we &apos;re going to invest all our efforts to take that degree of champi@@ ons .
in the last season we didn &apos;t get away .
in May we took a disappointment , since we talked to the op@@ tim@@ al conditions to finish first .
we had a strong season .
we finished with 79 points .
normally , with 79 points we should have been champi@@ ons ...
but another team , Mont@@ pe@@ lli@@ er , had a rather better season .
this year I think it &apos;ll be good .
even if the big teams like the Mar@@ sel@@ la , the Lyon and Bur@@ deos fought for the title , I think we &apos;ve got the weapons to take us .
do you think the media wait more than P@@ S@@ G ?
it &apos;s normal that you wait a lot of us if we think of what &apos;s been invested in the players we have .
we &apos;ve totally accepted it .
after we win 4 @-@ 0 at home to Tro@@ yes , they still find things that blame us is a bit frustrated .
we &apos;re wondering what else people wait .
we &apos;ll never be able to win 4 @-@ 0 every weekend .
we &apos;re not the F@@ C Barcelona !
we &apos;re trying to put a game out .
a team is built in time .
in the champi@@ ons we &apos;ve shown that we can answer and be present .
look at Manchester City .
in view of the investment sums , we &apos;d imagine you with 15 advantage points .
that would be un@@ taken care of our opponents and the champi@@ on@@ ship of France .
Lyon and Mar@@ sel@@ la , that they weren &apos;t all right the last season , they &apos;ve been seen by this new P@@ S@@ G .
that shows the League 1 is passionate .
I hope that in May we can say with a smile , despite all the difficulties , we &apos;re done by taking the tro@@ phy .
the P@@ S@@ G seems fully dependent on Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ an@@ ov@@ ic &apos;s success .
better say we have a Z@@ lat@@ an@@ dependence .
that means that I@@ bra@@ him@@ ov@@ ic is very competent and to put a lot of hands .
he has come to prove he &apos;s the fan of League 1 .
and he has shown in all the equipment that he has passed that he &apos;s a big player , a world star .
in the group we respect the man and the player .
and he also respects men who have their around .
what &apos;s done is really exceptional .
that push the others to increase their level of game .
Thi@@ ago Silva , one of the best follow@@ ers in the world , allow everyone to progress .
how did you live the R@@ glass 2012 ?
it &apos;s been a disappointment .
he was very excited to participate in this Euro@@ drink .
unfortunately , my l@@ ession didn &apos;t put me in a game of time .
I saw things in there and I got strengthened .
today I get good games in the selection .
it &apos;s what I expected from my b@@ ap@@ tism with the &quot; ble@@ es . &quot;
we learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and it must be today .
what vision have you got the first month of Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ sham@@ ps to the front of the fr@@ idge ?
he &apos;s getting results .
they &apos;re all right in the classification group for the World .
the selec@@ tor is thorough , close to players and inspire to win .
like the Laur@@ ent Bl@@ anc case .
but I don &apos;t want to compare .
Bl@@ anc &apos;s got his objective of classi@@ fying us for the Euro@@ glass .
I hope Di@@ di@@ er Des@@ sham@@ ps take the selection to Brazil .
the pack .
that game gave us confidence .
every one fought for everyone .
before that shock in Spain , he hadn &apos;t lived a game in my entire career .
with B@@ it@@ owski , pay and sell without banks .
the opposite of the current trade , based on the central banks , the transactions identified and the charges of processing between the parts .
besides , as often happens in the technologies , political vision is pal@@ p@@ able , the belief that the current monetary system , of bank identity , has taken the financial crises .
in fact , B@@ it@@ owski , invented by S@@ ato@@ shi N@@ ak@@ am@@ oto .
they &apos;ve been registered near 200@@ ,000 transactions .
and close to a thousand websites accept the le@@ af like donations or as a way to pay .
the le@@ af , after I &apos;ve come to the top of $ 30@@ ,000 .
it &apos;s nothing impressive if we compare the world changes in real coin or financial products .
however , the European Central Bank was interested in him in a report about the virtu@@ al coins published in October .
he was described at the le@@ af like the virtual coin with more success , &quot; that bu@@ gs with the dollar or the euro &quot; and &quot; similar to conventional coins . &quot;
B@@ it@@ coin &apos;s unlike other systems with the virtu@@ al coins as the &quot; credits , &quot; used to move in a vi@@ de@@ game and that can be bought by playing or can be bought .
the F@@ ace@@ book network developed this kind of system .
but in all exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes .
with the le@@ af , all the news of the network is at once deposi@@ ts of accounting books , chec@@ kers , coin trans@@ porters and bought tickets .
how does that network work ?
every transaction between two users is actually in reality between two electronic addresses in shape .
a user can choose a different address for every payment , guaranteeing the an@@ on@@ im@@ ate .
a collection of information to this transaction .
the network can thus verify the acid of the transaction .
thank you .
the key key is to write that new transaction in that book .
this is by the resolution of a mathem@@ ati@@ cal challenge launched the computers and winner , a kind of Central ban@@ ker , will have the privilege to add that line .
it &apos;s about a piece of com@@ ra@@ de , I mean , transformation of a great fic@@ tion on a shorter @-@ and @-@ single print .
computers &quot; co@@ gen &quot; the new transaction and add a number before &quot; tro@@ ar . &quot;
target is to find the number that offer a particular print .
once you find that number , the other two checks easily that it &apos;s the good .
the transaction is then in@@ destruc@@ tably linked to the joint of the other transactions , all changes would change the print .
Yeah , to commit a fraud , a user would like to pay twice with the same money as fast as 10 minutes , the network would only accept as a valid one .
the computer who solved the challenge is 50 cents .
to avoid inflation , that reward divide two regularly , with prob@@ ability before the end of 2012 .
the number of le@@ af in circulation is , well , limited to 21 million , but they &apos;re visible until the sub@@ section , which leaves a wide margin .
the difficulty of this challenge revealed in every increase in calcul@@ ation power .
the life of the network has its al@@ low .
the websites that offer services for B@@ it@@ owski have been attacked and stolen in war@@ ehouse .
&quot; the failure used doesn &apos;t affect the same protocol , &quot; guarantees Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , that he just launched Pay@@ mi@@ um , a payment company who uses the B@@ it@@ owski network .
the ECB has also considered the possibilities of money , thank you .
but cash in cash presents the same negative .
weight actors like Wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a reject the payments of this guy .
others , like the W@@ ord@@ press platform , accept them .
recently , A@@ di S@@ ham@@ ir and Dor@@ it Ron , the We@@ ic@@ mann We@@ iz@@ mann is in Israel , analy@@ zed the book book and showed that near 80 % of bit@@ om .
in November they set up the cr@@ ack@@ ers .
&quot; they changed $ 30@@ ,000 , &quot; he re@@ pul@@ sed J@@ on Hol@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , who works for Co@@ in@@ Grand@@ l , which makes the gold gold .
Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , author of a book .
your system , Pay@@ tun@@ ia , is a credit card .
the port@@ er , plus , does his identity and can , therefore remain in the an@@ on@@ im@@ ate .
the system is easy to put in the food , they don &apos;t have to inst@@ all new fin@@ als or sof@@ tw@@ ars .
it &apos;s enough to supply a address that a phone can &quot; photo@@ graph and recognize &quot; , &quot; accurate Pierre No@@ iz@@ at , which ensures having thousands of users .
there &apos;s a general review of the forest systems for more horizontal systems .
&quot; it takes a time for B@@ it@@ owski to be imposed , but in 2013 there could be a change , &quot; ready .
by other way , in your report the ECB fores@@ ees the various risks , today consider high , in case this coin succeed .
we &apos;re out of Afghanistan .
and then ?
French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan .
NATO and Americans must get out of 2014 .
it &apos;s time for the army to take possession of their territory and the af@@ faces choose their future , without waiting for us .
we &apos;ve punished all the pe@@ as@@ ants , which we &apos;ve considered terrorists .
and ourselves , with our 88 soldiers murdered , more the wounded and under@@ s .
the Taliban count with foreign extremists and former refugees in Pakistan , but often with pe@@ as@@ ants who reject the presence of foreign military , as in times of the Soviet .
they want to defend their traditions , old and ar@@ ca@@ kes , even if their causes are joining the Tai@@ al@@ ists , the cro@@ gs , the Arab@@ s or the cu@@ bes .
tolerated , sometimes even helped by local in@@ surg@@ ents , these will not be when the Western people make it more discre@@ te .
the French troops of the Ni@@ j@@ r@@ ab base of Ni@@ j@@ r@@ ab , which I watched from the high @-@ ups of al@@ mon@@ es thank the French credits , became an order .
the truc@@ ks of truc@@ ks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack , watched by helicop@@ ters .
there will be no Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014 .
the circumstances have changed from its ir@@ resis@@ tible progress between 1994 and 1996 .

your control of the country had been seen as a kind of liber@@ ation , return to security .
the s@@ ail@@ ers paid the dark price of their pe@@ as@@ ants survived by the organization Al @-@ Qaeda , but their situation is not better today .
the old mu@@ y@@ ah@@ id@@ ers , the current government and the current Taliban will share the wish to keep women in a lower position .
the main person@@ alities of the anti @-@ Soviet war returned to power in 2001 .
they &apos;ve become specul@@ ators , making with government soil to fli@@ p them like sun@@ shine for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan , benefiting the couple of American sub@@ hire contracts .
they &apos;re dis@@ charged , most of them didn &apos;t fight .
people , as I heard in the field , is a government who &apos;s not formed by thi@@ eves .
a lot of young people want to leave , as they will also know how to take advantage of American generosity , the capital le@@ ak is considerable .
young people are tired of war and their ide@@ o@@ logies .
they &apos;ve lived the modern world during their ex@@ ts in Iran or Pakistan and Pakistan and they &apos;ve appreciated their advantages .
around a 65 % of their younger population , Kabul counts right now with five million inhabitants , a fifth of the total population .
in cities , the state schools are full of girls like children .
there will be a job to those young people who won &apos;t want to go back to the dark @-@ ups or corruption of certain leaders .
everyone , including armed opposition , are cell phones .
the army is now present .
will you consider legitimate authorities to run the country ?
the former com@@ ap@@ ers of the anti @-@ Soviet struggle are worried about re@@ aching the vir@@ als , which will escape from power power .
Afghanistan , the country of mountains , of strong local identities , I should be able to benefit from a certain identification of the Western nations , however , the United States have wanted to transform into a state @-@ in @-@ law @-@ in @-@ law @-@ in @-@ law .
President Kar@@ z@@ ai doesn &apos;t want foreign control in particular with reason for the elections in April 2014 .
however , your country depends on foreign aid since the 50 and even before .
no industry has re@@ established their services , he hasn &apos;t arranged any emb@@ al@@ se or they &apos;re repa@@ ired the ir@@ rig@@ ation systems .
it &apos;s all imported and there &apos;s nothing except fruit and vegetables .
priority leaves the private initiative .
in a country ruined after 30 years of war , it would &apos;ve been necessary government control .
he expanded the rumor that Afghanistan had immense bl@@ ades .
and that didn &apos;t make more than increasing the feeling that the Western were there to take care of them .
without energy to extr@@ act the iron , or the co@@ okie of the land and no way to export them through the mountains , there &apos;s no mining exploitation .
the Chinese are almost abandoned by M@@ es A@@ yn@@ ak &apos;s co@@ okie mines , letting the international ar@@ alo@@ logi@@ sts out of the World Bank Ex@@ dig the world of the world .
he &apos;s also missing Afghanistan and Pakistan , country which depends heavily on imports and exports , restored their normal relations .
French troops stopped November 20 .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the following of traditional aid , schools of children , children , a French department in college , the French Institute , cooperation in military areas , the French Institute .
since 2009 , with the object of trying to &quot; earn the hearts and spirits &quot; and the spirit of making the impossible to make the help and the off@@ ended @-@ by @-@ and @-@ military actions of the Ministry of Def@@ ense , the Ministry of Def@@ ense . &quot;
those jobs , go@@ ose to get local work , they could help to contain the cour@@ rec@@ tion , ri@@ bs , water , water , water , temper@@ ation , temper@@ ation , temper@@ ation trees , solar protection and increasing surface levels .
what will we have to remember after two million military costs ?
a rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local life conditions , very harsh in those val@@ ons often .
the emb@@ assy received dozens of demands written with small agricultural proposals by local province of K@@ ap@@ isa province .
to get rid of the cour@@ rec@@ tion done by the foreign groups , something that farmers have told me that they want , I would have to keep a small civilian help , well controlled and that they &apos;re going directly .
a Constitution with str@@ ats in Egypt
it &apos;s a new double or nothing president Moham@@ med Mor@@ si .
while Egypt is more divided than ever when the constitutional statement is , which is provided by which he has been able to play the whole thing .
he caught all the world by surprise , when he announced that the Federal House would vote his final text next day .
he &apos;s just a week , the State of State had given two months more to that House to finish their jobs .
and almost two years ago Egypt uses a temporary text , several times modified , which weak@@ ens institutional stability and take into court .
this new initiative has done more than increasing the frac@@ ture in the country .
for their oppon@@ ents , president persever@@ s in his &quot; deli@@ ghtful &quot; and continues &quot; betr@@ aying his word &quot; and &quot; tram@@ ming the right . &quot;
by the way of your supporters , it is that this is a measure to finish faster with the institutional and political crisis and speed up the transition process .
in the next 15 days I should have a referendum .
a very short weather pen oblig@@ es the Her@@ hands to give up your project to explain the text , article by article , the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
for the president , this is also a way to recover a popular and democratic leg@@ ance while the controversial cause of the entire country .
Moham@@ med Mor@@ si seems to be convinced that the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans will vote their favor , as claimed in an interview to the American week@@ ly .
considering that resource has been voted with a lot of speed , it contains a last attack for the Egyptian people : &quot; or vote my text or keep the full powers &quot; , &quot; powers which will supposedly come to their end with the adoption of the Constitution . &quot;
it &apos;s in that strange atmosphere that 85 members of this federal House , Islam@@ ist in his big majority , voted the text yesterday .
most of the Liberals didn &apos;t sleep .
in the middle of November , a little bit before the constitutional statement they had closed the door because they thought they couldn &apos;t make their views .
the representatives of human rights , religious minorities and civil society did the same thing .
in order to make the need necessary , yesterday by tomorrow he added 11 people , substitute members , all hurry .
some of them are very close to Muslims .
like I &apos;d like to wait , the articles voted for unanimity .
the comm@@ ers are funny , for another part , the fact that one of the little differences of time has been expressed practically at the time of or@@ activ@@ ation , so several members of the committee came to think that the lying of the lying was wrong .
the text , last night was still voted , you know 2@@ 34 items .
the article two , the object of all of them , is still identical to the Constitution of 197@@ 1 , which would stretch the principles of Sh@@ aria &apos;s are the primary source of the right . &quot;
the le@@ ather parties , for those of the Islamic law is a fundamental claim , hoping that they could replace the principles &quot; for &quot; rules , &quot; which would have allowed a more strict application .
for the Islam@@ ists , that this article has not been altered is a guarantee of your good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society .
the liber@@ als of hypocrisy and they think it &apos;s not more than a din@@ er .
according to them , the Islam@@ ization of the Constitution is done through other items .
they refer , especially , to Article 220 , which provides the University @-@ Az@@ h@@ ar University , especially for all that to confirm their compliance with Sh@@ aria &apos;s laws .
according to the speci@@ alist in Egypt Sophie Pom@@ mi@@ er , it turns out to be disturbing because &quot; people call it not elected and no democratic legitimacy . &quot;
here we are .
the fears of the Liberals are also growing up by the fact that the next Head of a university would be less moderate than the current .
&quot; for now , there &apos;s no concrete religious involvement . &quot;
with this Constitution we &apos;re in the state of civilian .
most of the jur@@ ors who have worked in that text are not de@@ ems , but college , some of them formed in the French system , explains Alex@@ is Bl@@ ou@@ et , that set up a theory on the Egyptian transition .
but he recogni@@ zes that there may be a certain confusion around Article 220 , because the terms are concerned about the religious character .
&quot; we refer to the term to the De@@ q@@ h . &quot;
and the question that could consider in the future would be what the civil judges are in order to decide above all this . &quot;
beyond your religious character , the text voted yesterday has received a lot of criticism that they refer to the power of the Republic .
Muslim Bro@@ thers will be happy that they &apos;re a few compared to the ones that were during the last regime .
another controversial point : powers to the army .
according to the wish of the military , the Def@@ ense budget will not be submitted to Parliament , but a national defense council .
they will not be banned civilians in military courts , like they asked the associations for human rights .
you &apos;re also showing your concerns about the text , which you consider free .
the crime of blas@@ femin@@ ia is keeping up and in now on the way , the insul@@ ts are forbidden , which could cause serious consequences for freedom of expression , especially the press .
besides , no article emphasises the protection of women , underlines H@@ eb@@ a Mor@@ ay@@ ef , of Human Rights Watch .
according to her , the only positive thing has been the ban ban with Article 36 .
the word didn &apos;t count in the previous Constitution .
even though the Egyptian president should get out last night at TV , he was anticipated for this noon .
the chief of State State was told Saturday .
in Israel , the Japanese tourists are waiting for the sacred land , the br@@ acel@@ et of the world and a sea of sal@@ die .
the Earth promised to fight the maj@@ esty of bi@@ blic@@ al vegetables with the modern comfort and a pr@@ ick nature .

rever@@ ence in Santa
worth visiting the river river where Jesus was b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed .
he thinks anyone who enter this &quot; p@@ enci@@ sm@@ sm@@ al &quot; will get the grace .
and curi@@ osity , the place of the mirac@@ les of Jesus , the water conversion in the wedding , walking over the waters , the rush of the storm and the re@@ ple@@ es .
in this same place , Jesus showed up to your disci@@ ples after the resur@@ rec@@ tion .
but most of the holy places are in Jerusalem .
the beli@@ ers remember here the Vi@@ ac@@ ru@@ ci@@ s or the Ch@@ ine of Jesus &apos;s Cross .
start in the For@@ ness of Antonio , the Pre@@ tty , where the trial was made , and continues by the streets of the Vi@@ de City , goes to the Holy Se@@ pul@@ cr@@ o in the Mon@@ te G@@ ó@@ l@@ l@@ l@@ ore , the place of the cruci@@ fi@@ xi@@ xi@@ a , the place of the cruci@@ fi@@ xi@@ ity ,
in this same place you are also the Christian O@@ mb@@ li@@ go in the world , that you taste humanity &apos;s salv@@ ation .
and the Santa &apos;s mon@@ aster@@ y in Jerusalem , built in the place where , according to a Christian leg@@ end , there was a tree that made the cross for Jesus &apos;s cruci@@ fi@@ replace .
in Jerusalem , you &apos;re also the most sacred place for the Jews , the f@@ eds of the Lam@@ ent@@ ations , the remains of a temp@@ le destroyed by the Rom@@ ans .
like tradition , people of different religions leave up here with their wishes , then they will come true .
take a vertical trip .
the ru@@ tal@@ ness of For@@ ness Mas@@ ada was what left a secret shelter against enemies , which Her@@ o@@ des the Gran@@ o@@ des was building in 25 to his family .
they find them in mountain cli@@ lls a height of 450 m on the sea level .
and get up there for your own media , you can only get those to get into the cli@@ ff .
the others can get to this historic summit in the funeral .
and in the north of the country to an 16@@ 00@@ @-@ 20@@ 40 .
so far , since the hill of the hill is offered bus services .
the full length of the s@@ wine is 45 miles .
according to an ancient leg@@ end , at the top of the mountain they used to be paid by the gods .
visit unique muse@@ ums
in this country there are 300 muse@@ ums .
in a single journey you can &apos;t visit all of it .
but it &apos;s worth visiting at least five of them , the most interesting .
among them is the Israeli Mu@@ se@@ o , located near K@@ nes@@ set .
he &apos;s keeping the ancient Man@@ us@@ cri@@ ts in the Mu@@ erto Sea or Rol@@ las de Qu@@ m@@ will , dis@@ cover@@ ts in the desert &apos;s c@@ aves , and around 500 grand pieces .
it &apos;s worth visiting the Mu@@ se@@ o Mu@@ se@@ o in T@@ el Avi@@ v .
in your pa@@ int@@ ings count with impres@@ sions and impres@@ sion@@ ists like Mon@@ et , P@@ iss@@ arr@@ o , Ren@@ o@@ ir , C@@ é@@ ir , C@@ atis@@ ley , S@@ is@@ li@@ ani , C@@ atis@@ li@@ ani , Cha@@ g@@ all or Pic@@ as@@ so .
in Ac@@ re can visit the muse@@ um Al Bas@@ ha , that they are some former Turkish @-@ old @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ American muse@@ ists .
in C@@ es@@ field worth spending the exclusive private muse@@ um Ral@@ li , where they can ad@@ ore Ro@@ din &apos;s s@@ cultures and Dal@@ í .
there &apos;s no tourist gu@@ ts or dirty st@@ ores .
the entrance is free , and categorically not accept donations .
the fifth , the Mu@@ se@@ o Mu@@ se@@ to or Y@@ ad V@@ ash@@ em in T@@ el Avi@@ v , shows one of the most dramatic pages in history .
the most tragic section is the Mem@@ orial of children , built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration fields and cameras .
come in and find you in absolute darkness .
stars brilliant .
and sound the names of Jewish children and names of the countries that lost life .
Ukraine mentioned too .
Cheers
the three main tourist areas in Israel find the sea shore , the Red Sea and Mu@@ erto Sea .
in every one of them there &apos;s sp@@ in@@ ning , sp@@ in@@ ning , thin , thin and muse@@ tive muse@@ ums .
it &apos;s funny that in the Red Sea they are even in the months of winter , as the temperature of water don &apos;t get down at 21 degrees and air heat until 23 degrees .
the Mu@@ erto Sea is still more warm and over there all year .
by the way , this sea , the most extraordinary in the world , is at the lowest point of the planet .
blue waters in there are a le@@ ak that easily support the ones who don &apos;t know swimming .
the gu@@ ts are really beautiful .
people come here to spend courses of treatment with water water , jump out and rel@@ axed and heal@@ ing their health in cases of mel@@ mati@@ tis , aller@@ gies , p@@ enci@@ tis , aller@@ gy , sub@@ tit@@ tis , sub@@ tit@@ tis .
playing the mysterious age of anti@@ age
keeping the former part of T@@ el Avi@@ v , it &apos;s J@@ aff@@ a &apos;s .
because she was the famous maritime route that I joined Egypt , Syria , An@@ ato@@ lia and M@@ es@@ o@@ the@@ ami@@ a .
the city is mentioned in ancient Greek leg@@ ends and Egyptian .
according to the leg@@ end , it was where No@@ é built his ar@@ ca and Per@@ se@@ o rescu@@ ed the beautiful An@@ dro@@ me@@ da with whom , in this same place , he took a long and happy life .
the tourists love to walk through the next streets that the names of the Z@@ odi@@ ac are .
they say that if you touch the walls in your own , the fortune , the fortune will be for you .
in J@@ aff@@ a &apos;s way to get married couples from all over Israel , and even other countries to photo@@ graph .
and in C@@ es@@ field , the city of King Her@@ o@@ des can walk through the Roman the@@ ater , &quot; take the strength of the cross . &quot;
in the Roman time , C@@ es@@ field was the main city of Ju@@ dea and the residence of the Roman workers , including Pon@@ cio Pil@@ ate .
the theatre , carefully restored , is used now to con@@ certain some night @-@ and @-@ fe@@ a@@ bles .
tourists remember
if you travel to Israel , you don &apos;t mind if your English leaves a lot to wish : in this country around 30 % of the population talks Russian .
the money for this trip is not recommended in euros , but in dollars , that they can easily change sh@@ é@@ qu@@ els , 8 @-@ 3 , 8 @-@ 3 .
the urban transport is primarily the buses , but in Jerusalem , there &apos;s a fast way and in Hai@@ fa is the only way the country in the country , which knows six stations and connec@@ ting the missing city with the High City .
actually , it &apos;s a sub@@ way .
travel in any public transport , cost 6 sh@@ é@@ els and this price can travel by transferring by 1.5 hours .
in Israel , according to the Jewish tradition , the she@@ ets are .
since night on Friday night , the sun and loc@@ ks and loc@@ ks and public transport will tear their job .
but Sunday morning begins a new job .
in a lot of coffee , restaur@@ ants and hot@@ els only use ko@@ sher food , which exclu@@ des pig meat , mar@@ sh@@ co , fish without s@@ cam@@ es and meat .
there is a large selection of meat @-@ based dish@@ es and lam@@ b , be@@ ts and pa@@ irs , so@@ b@@ bles .
in the streets of Israeli towns , no street dogs .
in exchange , there &apos;s a lot of good cats fed up in their taste .
by night you can see them sleeping even about the cars of cars .
the loc@@ k@@ ers love the loc@@ king places and don &apos;t reject the go@@ ons .
the rent of a car , depending on the mark , it cost 37 bucks .
besides the insurance , that goes by 15 bucks day .
and the rent of a bic@@ ycle will get 15 sh@@ ri@@ els on the day .
the tickets to the muse@@ ums a half of 30 sh@@ é@@ els .
Israel in numbers
2012 visited Israel more than three million tourists in the world .
most of those who were going to go to the country and rest citizens in America , Russia , France , France , Italy , Britain and Ukraine .
the Pro@@ me@@ oned Earth , January January 2012 2012 , was visited by 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 8 Japanese tourists , a lot of foreign @-@ year @-@ old @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@
&quot; big and powerful &quot; will take you to Moscow . &quot;
as long as gentlemen and defenders of human rights argue about the consequences that I would bring the law on the mandatory test , they &apos;ve appeared in the tim@@ est country .
every year , 13 million immigrant workers come to Moscow , San Peters@@ burg and other Russian cities .
mostly citizens of Central Asian countries : Uzbekistan , Bab@@ ik@@ istan and Anderson .
your only target is to earn money to help your families out of home .
since December 1 December , a law is in effect , according to which every working immigrant has to take a test to check out their knowledge of the Russian language .
for now , this rule is applicable only to those who have the intention of working in the services sector , community services services , domestic services and commerce .
however , with time , as promised in the Federal Im@@ migration Service , the exam@@ s will be mandatory for all immigrants .
besides , it won &apos;t be enough to give the test of the tongue , if not the Russian history and based on the laws .
knowledge of the tongue will have to confirm even to receive and renew the job permit .
they &apos;re the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the official tongue .
they will not be subjected to this law the people who managed to get their education certificates and diplomas before the Union &apos;s di@@ solution in 1991 .
use , fat@@ ality and defense of rights
the network network is going to work with the Russian Water Institute P@@ ush@@ kin , the University of the A@@ ami@@ kin University , the State University of Japan , the State University of San Peters@@ burg and other Russian teaching institutions .
immigrants will be able to introduce evidence in all the cities , right now in Russia they are open more than 100 kinds of this guy .
the initiative on the introduction of the test was supported by the members of the State State and the Federal Im@@ migration Service .
but the defenders of rights , so long before the law entered into reality , they made a lot of times to do this question to the press .
what changes will be made of knowledge of the tongue of knowledge , so for the Russians and for the immigrants ?
first , they answer the representatives of the Im@@ migration Service , this will allow the number of people to suffer .
a lot of people speak today about the defense of labour rights , explain Victor S@@ eb@@ ore , chief of the Federal Im@@ migration Service in Taj@@ ik@@ istan .
the defense of their rights must begin before their game .
only a selection system will allow to solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90 % of cases .
the problems have the immigrants without a profession , education , the ones who don &apos;t know the tongue or no medical control .
without understanding of the tongue , he claims S@@ eb@@ ario , the future immigrant will be condemned to find some un@@ scrupulous people who , with the pretext of helping , to a cre@@ epy , and a lot of other people who have been paid for the day without food or documents , by which he and dozens of others like him .
we received a complaint number of our immigrants .
&quot; in your homeland , you promised a thing , but when you &apos;re fo@@ ol@@ ed , you &apos;re off your passports , you &apos;re off your passports , you &apos;re not paying the promise of the migration of the migration Service , &quot; you &apos;re not paying the power of the immigration immigration service , &quot;
I don &apos;t get angry , Chief !
however , as long as a lot of citizens in Central Asian re@@ public who want to work in Russia , they just don &apos;t know the tongue of the country they intend to go , but also in their own writing with difficulty .
of course , this isn &apos;t his fault but his own mis@@ fortune , it &apos;s just a few shif@@ k@@ less cars , u@@ z@@ bec@@ os , that they can afford to receive basic education .
this must be that their families even have nothing to feed the kids , for not talking to them , shut them up and buy them to school .
when we get to the teen@@ ager , these guys get away to work the first chance .
it &apos;s hard , if you don &apos;t know the tongue , they recognize them .
&quot; one feels humili@@ ated and less . &quot;
however , what you mean is the law on the tongue , the defenders of rights pointing a point .
the exam@@ s will take only for those immigrants whose status is legal .
if you don &apos;t have that status , there will be no test and no official work .
meanwhile , most immigrant workers are still living in Russia illegally .
&quot; welcome or forbidden . &quot;
many visitors claim to receive official status in our country is not so easy .
cause is in the bureaucratic obstacles and in their tongue in their tongue .
besides , leg@@ alization costs money : 12 grand a thousand bucks .
however , a false record can be done quickly and for only a thousand ru@@ irs .
the Russian police employees know that usually we &apos;ve got fake documents , we &apos;re not registered and dis@@ appearing the cases of extor@@ tion .
&quot; we &apos;re asking for a hundred or twice ru@@ sty cigarettes for cigarettes or tea , &quot; he said the journalists the citizen of Taj@@ ik@@ istan , U@@ med Hus@@ h@@ k@@ ad@@ am@@ ov .
&quot; come on , don &apos;t be a cli@@ ff , buy a painting . &quot;
the first day in reality of the law on the tongue , he made it manif@@ est that not just the immigrant records can be fake .
several certificates &quot; false knowledge of the tongue has been sub@@ au@@ ted by civil immigration officers . &quot;
the falsi@@ fied documents had been printed in standard color .
of course , they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift : every immigrant , they want to facilitate the task of spending the evidence , paid for the seven @-@ dollar document .
this is twice and more expensive than the official test procedure , which will cost the immigrant workers three ru@@ irs .
the main task to a future is to protect the system against corruption so that &quot; diplomas &quot; can &apos;t be bought , are the government officials and defenders of rights .
until the moment , the authorities can promise the immigrant workers who didn &apos;t have any success in the first time to study the next time to study the basic course of the tongue .
besides , immigrants who don &apos;t speak Russian , they will offer you jobs that don &apos;t require active communication with people .
the Ministry of Home doesn &apos;t take drastic measures against the illegal weapons .
the percentage of crime committed is fairly short
the Ministry of Justice proposes to apply the law with major self @-@ ordin@@ ability in relation to civilian weapons owners .
this is the government &apos;s reaction to the recent incidents : sque@@ eze shots for cel@@ eb@@ ons in which fortunately didn &apos;t have victims , and the massacre started by the Li@@ co@@ v@@ ita D@@ ino@@ gr@@ ite .
the police want to ban the use and possession of trau@@ matic weapons in public places and raise the minimum for the license for the license , 18 years .
this idea was supported by the chief of the Committee of Security and fighting corruption , Ir@@ ina Y@@ ar@@ ov@@ aya , who promised that the reforms in law possession will be taken into the state in a future .
not everyone feels happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter@@ end this problem by applying it .
in the network he showed up an open letter , whose authors , representatives of various social fighters , demand that you get rid of such sever@@ ity measures .
the percentage of v@@ and@@ alism with using weapons is minimum , reported to the BBC news of BBC Russia , the criminal lawyer V@@ asi@@ li@@ y .
according to the Ministry of Hom@@ ers , for six months , 2012 was committed by the way by the 2012 of fire@@ arms in organ organs , front of 1@@ 16@@ 8 crimes registered for this same period .
the authors of the letter open are certain that one more strict legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconveni@@ ence for the criminal to turn into the black market .
now , according to your words , in Moscow , you can find any weapon under the price .
meanwhile , in the Ministry of Home claims the situation of illegal weapons is under control .
suppliers : from factories to officers .
the black market is supply through several channels .
the main channels are years , he says the retired Colonel Bar@@ an@@ ets Bar@@ an@@ ets , who worked for 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the High State .
screen capture that accepts orders from weapons .
the first , &quot; The army of the army or military , &quot; I mean the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus .
&quot; weapons were hur@@ led by Russian officers and the same plat@@ asi@@ cs &quot; says Bar@@ an@@ ets .
the next type of black weapon , stolen by criminals and representatives of security forces .
Bar@@ an@@ ets explains that here you include the guns of the police war@@ dro@@ be and those rob@@ bed rob@@ bers directly for enforcement enforcement organs .
illegal weapons go to the sale from military chains .
in a lot of military , he had often explo@@ sions .
&quot; there are evidence of evidence that some fires were exposed to cover the missing , &quot; ate an ex@@ military . &quot;
according to Bar@@ an@@ ets , the weapons manufacturers also put your sand from sand .
&quot; now they &apos;ve spread private weapons of weapons that they &apos;re not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the black market , including Moscow . &quot;
one more source of black market is the smuggling .
a lot of guns and machine machine come from poor countries like Luke .
&quot; there you are with your own production , sometimes arti@@ al , and he has formed a mafia that has organized the flow of weapons , explain the ex @-@ military . &quot;
where &apos;s the guns coming from ?
experts have calculated which is the result of each of these illegal weapons supply sources to the black market .
a report on this subject was drawn up in 2011 by the analysis of the analysis and public management .
experts analy@@ zed the Ministry &apos;s reports and Ros@@ therine , crime syn@@ o@@ graphy and public access data whose fear are on the weapons .
the vast majority of illegal weapons , according to investig@@ ators , come from armed forces and security forces .
the middle of the black market has come in there &quot; because of officials whose work is related to the weapons , &quot; it says in the report . &quot;
according to the investig@@ ators , 17 % of the weapons come from places where armed conflicts are coming from , 14 % of the cases .
the dependent on one of the arms store , that he said his last name wasn &apos;t mentioned , says that the weapons found for illegal exc@@ ap@@ ers didn &apos;t buy them for a long time because they &apos;re too old .
more often , he says , the suppliers are headed for military war@@ dro@@ be when they need a game .
through some sign , the supplier buy a unit , for example a T@@ T gun .
they eliminate the record and get through the fence .
&quot; this has the weapon to the city and sell it to 900 bucks by unit with two . &quot;
&quot; but , of course , the police are so much of all the business , so strictly , when we need to meet the discovery of crime in the illegal weapons , they &apos;re making the property . &quot;
&quot; like a luxury bou@@ ti@@ que . &quot;
the vend@@ or and the bu@@ yer usually find you through acqua@@ int@@ ance .
&quot; I visited the website and b@@ log@@ s until a guy who proposed to me to go to the Be@@ go@@ va . &quot; where would I be a man who would take me to a ... &quot;
the price of the gun , I heard just there .
military announ@@ cer Bar@@ an@@ ets
&quot; to get a gun , I need a friend to have contacts , &quot; he says the source of the store . &quot; I have a friend like that , but I don &apos;t trust much in it . &quot;
in the markets , there &apos;s a ven@@ eer , but there is also something to be done , say &quot; part of Mr. Iv@@ ano@@ vi@@ h , that he asked you to tell her that he was falling into his daughter . &quot;
even if I can get a couple of steel man@@ rels through a trust person .
he also supply them to me because he knows I &apos;m not going to rat him .
the new@@ ers are looking for different ways .
the ex @-@ army Vik@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets put into evidence at the illegal weapon of the illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990 , when I was allowed to publish an article about this .
the s@@ burn , according to their words , they didn &apos;t change .
they gave him a photo al@@ bum where he wasn &apos;t &quot; everything . &quot;
&quot; I felt like a fancy bou@@ ti@@ que , remember the military . &quot;
the bu@@ yer , according to Bar@@ an@@ ets &apos;s words , he doesn &apos;t offer him a cat for li@@ eutenant .
I , like a potential client , not just buy it , come with the gro@@ om , where we put a target .
&quot; give me the chance to shoot and when I assure you that the weapon will dis@@ appoint , we start negotiating &quot; , &quot; described the procedure .

search engines lead to places and groups of &quot; V@@ k@@ on@@ tak@@ te , &quot; where he offered to buy guns for different purposes . &quot;
this doesn &apos;t require any papers or personal meetings .
&quot; it &apos;s enough to have a certain amount of money , &quot; write in the adverti@@ sal of the adverti@@ sed notice . &quot;
the users are making their orders and questions .
and they sell minors ?
&quot; without permission , of course &quot; , question the user &quot; Iv@@ án . &quot;
&quot; buy a gun T@@ T . &quot;
the Federal Security Service has created a huge web of Web sites and capture two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons .
and people are going , like hungry fish , and then to extr@@ act coal in Siber@@ ia
military announ@@ cer and ex@@ military Bar@@ an@@ ets
I heard about these systems .
people make the orders .
the bu@@ yer does the payment through an automatic dra@@ wer .
&quot; in answer , you sent a picture and the instructions to know where he &apos;s hiding the weapon , &quot; rel@@ axed the secretary of the media , D@@ mi@@ tri K@@ is@@ lov . &quot;
Vik@@ tor Bar@@ an@@ ets claims that if you ask a line in line , one stays without a weapon and put it in jail .
the Federal Security Service has created a huge web of Web sites and capture two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons .

M@@ ak@@ Batman for 100 bucks
in the illegal fire@@ arms , according to the experts , one can spend 100 bucks .
according to D@@ mi@@ tri K@@ is@@ lov from the NGOs &quot; the right to weapons , a M@@ ak@@ Batman gun can be bought by 100 @-@ 300 . &quot;

according to the official officers in the office , compared to the January @-@ October period of 2011 , the total number of these crimes in Russia was reduced in a 7 % , which is 2@@ 2.@@ 900 , which is 2@@ 2.@@ 900 , which is 2@@ 2.@@ 900 , and the number of cases identified in a 7@@ 8 % .
they get on strike employees fast and super@@ markets in America .
until a quarter of American teen@@ ag@@ ers find their first jobs as a dra@@ wer in Mc@@ Donald &apos;s .
in the last few days , the United States has started a wave of protests against the lowest wages paid into the super@@ markets of the Wal@@ mar@@ t and restaur@@ ants in restaur@@ ants , and in restaur@@ ants for fast food chains , &quot; S@@ aco B@@ ell &quot; , &quot; S@@ aco B@@ ell &quot;
for now nobody dare to take a chance if he gets or not this wave to nine points , or if he has to lose forces and love in their first stages .
protest shares count with the support of the unions and a series of left NGOs .
besides the increase of the man@@ ners and the people of Wal@@ mar@@ t and the fast food system , the goal of the suspects is the creation of workers in these companies .
for now , this sector of the economy practically has not been busy by the union movement .
quarter and six cents a year ?
the actions began last week , after the day of Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , called the Black V@@ ier@@ nes .
that day , some of the Wal@@ mar@@ t corporations , which uses 2.@@ 2 million people in the world , abandoned their jobs and form@@ ks of protest with the unions and the left @-@ ups in the corpor@@ ation store , whose products are headed to man@@ ners .
Wal@@ mar@@ t &apos;s selling everything , from di@@ aper@@ s , hunting rif@@ les and batteries for cars , until aspir@@ ers , eggs and milk .
the products in their st@@ ores are average between a 8 % and a hundred % cheaper than the super@@ markets .
that &apos;s why a lot of bad workers paid Wal@@ mar@@ t &apos;s job .
the availability and the sur@@ geon of products have done Wal@@ mar@@ t one of America &apos;s biggest corporations .
according to the words two critics , Wal@@ mar@@ t can afford to sell the luxury of selling products too low , partly because he pays for their workers .
these last ones also complain of the bad conditions , such as the lack of mon@@ he@@ ar@@ gas or scan@@ s .
that &quot; Black V@@ ier@@ nes &quot; are the participants of the manifest@@ ation and compl@@ ained that the insurance of the insurance insurance is passed by 30 bucks .
for a typical worker of Wal@@ mar@@ t , he gets $ 9@@ .5 per hour , this expense is over@@ loaded , they said .
scientists in California in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey argue that if Wal@@ mar@@ t increases the average salary to $ 12 per hour , this cost to cost to cost to cost $ 3.@@ 2 billion .
this is approximately 1.@@ 1 % more than he spend@@ s in wages now .
if Wal@@ mar@@ t puts the salary increase in consumers &apos; shoulders , every visit to the store will just be 46 plus cents .
in a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of 12@@ ,@@ 39 more than they spend now .
Wal@@ mar@@ t &apos;s supporters are satisfied that the protest had such a place in nine states and that caused no loss to the corporations .
the Black V@@ ier@@ nes was extended in their st@@ ores from the evening at midnight until midnight evening and during that time , Wal@@ mar@@ t sold around 5@@ 000 items per second .
in total , your boxes registered the Black V@@ ier@@ nes almost 100 million transactions .
the manager of the company , Dan F@@ og@@ el@@ man , declared in an interview to the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Po@@ st Web site , which left their job of &quot; less public relations , &quot; organised by the union union .
free free !
the protests continued this week in New York , in which the targets weren &apos;t exactly the big war@@ dro@@ be Wal@@ mar@@ t .
Mc@@ Donald &apos;s says that selling thousands of por@@ tions , and then I don &apos;t even give you the down@@ fall and not paid for your honest work !
Ju@@ ma@@ ane Williams , member of the New York council .
currently , according to federal law and New York , minimum salary is $ 7@@ 25 per hour .
fast food restaur@@ ants will be increasing with the time , but just slightly , the ordinary workers get in New York 8@@ ,@@ 90 per hour .
nobody wins less than them in this town .
how it &apos;s possible to survive in New York with that money , for me it &apos;s incomprehensible .
there was a time when the fourth part of American teen@@ ag@@ ers came through the Mc@@ Donald &apos;s and worked over there , behind the show , in partial time after school , even though they still lived with their parents .
few were the ones that looked like this as the main source of income or plan to stay there long .
now , constantly tro@@ tting up in some interview with Mc@@ Donald &apos;s workers who are complaining about this salary , and sometimes even feed their kids .
on the other hand , in a magazine of Wall Street , there &apos;s a comment whose author says he &apos;s irresponsible to have children if he doesn &apos;t know what to feed them .
the participants in the protests , which began at 6 : 30 in the Mc@@ Donald &apos;s morning and Mad@@ ison Aven@@ ue , they demand that their minimum salary is at least 15 bucks per hour , or is it , that their minimum salary is going to be paid for at least 15 bucks per hour , or is it , that their minimum salary is going to pay for at least 15 bucks per hour , which is so , that their minimum salary is .
they also demand that in the fast food sector they believe unions .
the United States law is for@@ bid the administration to ask for this right and punish the movements of the union with a com@@ edy .
by other way , rarely the administration gives them life .
but for objective reasons , it &apos;s easy that the unions get the food sector .
one of the main is the per@@ tation of staff .
dis@@ cord
no@@ is@@ ous protests had that same day in other restaur@@ ants from Man@@ hattan .
the culmin@@ ation of action had the middle of the mi@@ tin in the Mc@@ Donald &apos;s .
the protest@@ ers received the support of other New York Democrats , for example of the mayor of Bl@@ asi@@ o Bill of Bl@@ asi@@ o , which said &quot; we have to support the workers in the fast food sector so that we have to support the workers in the fast food . &quot;
like described the New York Times , this has been the greatest demonstration of this guy in the American food history .
but in her there were only a few hundreds of people , even though they were not all employees in the fast food service , in which they get dozens of thousands of New York people .
he &apos;s still not clear if this will get spar@@ k to get a massive move .
&quot; for now , fool the brain doesn &apos;t get so easy
the matter of reality increasing , so popular between the amat@@ eur@@ s to modern technologies , recently being seen by the favorite of glasses .
in the summer of summer , in your annual conference , he proved a model in motion and later , in November , he knew that Micro@@ soft had introduced a request to claim the corresponding patent .
however , from a conversation with the chief of the Inter@@ active technology group 3@@ D in Cam@@ bridge &apos;s lab , Iz@@ adi Shar@@ am@@ om , that &apos;s been dilu@@ ted to the scientists in the company , the glasses already belong@@ ed to a final phase .
they attract the perspective of the virtu@@ al objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of virtu@@ al sp@@ aces .
- Please , in general terms , what &apos;s the study of your research group ?
- We &apos;re devoted to the physical interaction , but we &apos;re trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
for now humanity in his great mass has been trapped in the work of the screen with the p@@ enci@@ els , sometimes it touches her finger .
but we want to look five @-@ 10 years ahead and guess the car@@ din@@ al changes in this interaction .
for example , the X@@ box and Kin@@ ec@@ t sen@@ sors represent a step forward and today no X@@ box is selling without Kin@@ ec@@ t , since all of you interested in control by g@@ ese .
- What else stop us for the future ?
even though Kin@@ ec@@ t has taken the physical interaction , big part of this still happens in a pl@@ ane , sometimes in 3@@ D .
the introduction of information has improved .
we &apos;re trying to change this , we work in real @-@ dimensional vi@@ su@@ zation systems , based on different technologies , including the desig@@ ns .
it must be released the world of the computer to our , the physical , do more tangible .
for this , however , we need to admit not only the user , but the space surrounding it .
then we &apos;ll be able to complete the real world with objects more comfortable .
first of all , the devil with those unusual little bac@@ ons of reality !
- What do you think about voice control ?
a very popular detail , but don &apos;t you think he survived it ?
- Of course you can &apos;t consider a cure , it &apos;s got to be solved the question of privacy , because you don &apos;t always want anyone to get out of our actions and intentions .
actually , all kinds of interaction with computers are good , but every one in their own field .
for example , for control control in public places , we had a project in which we think of the g@@ ents , but not free movements , but shorter .
besides , the g@@ ents were cap@@ tured not by the camera of the device , but by a thu@@ mb that sw@@ allows the bones of bones and mus@@ cle .
for now it &apos;s very big , but in theory , it can be reduced to the size of a toilet watch .
but in general , the future is for a combined control , for example of gesture + voice .
- How &apos;s that ?
- For example , how would you ask me to take it from this so@@ da ?
you &apos;ll talk and show the same time .
- Nor@@ m@@ ally I &apos;m just talking .
- Oh , that &apos;s gonna be really hard to recognize .
- Or you want to force the users to adapt to what can or can &apos;t do this right now the machine ?
- Not necessarily , but it &apos;s a mutual approach .
I think in a future then we will have to work primarily in the design of new sens@@ ators that can determine the reactions of the person .
these can be , for example , las@@ er , because they provide a good resolution in depth , which is very important .
- If we talk about your work with X@@ box Kin@@ ec@@ t &apos;s sen@@ sors , what are you complaining about the modern cameras ?
are you missing , depth or something ?
- At first , the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with Inter@@ dimensional recognition .
of course , it would be good to get eight me@@ g@@ ap@@ ia to 1,000 mi@@ ps .
but the point is not in the me@@ g@@ ap@@ es , but in the quality of ma@@ tri@@ x and in depth .
since this last point , all the current technologies are not good enough for us ; this gives more work to the alg@@ ori@@ m desig@@ ers .
I mean , we have to remember not only the resolution in X @-@ ray , and , too , Z@@ .
it &apos;s also important the speed , the number number .
human movements are pretty dynamic and the current 30 f@@ ps are really scarce , especially for the g@@ ents .
Steven B@@ ath@@ ic@@ ic@@ I , of our lab in Red@@ mond , made a contact with re@@ tar@@ ded re@@ tar@@ ded , and to mention that modern sens@@ ators are closer to the second value .
not the whole world understand what this means to a man @-@ machine .
I &apos;d be very helpful for my job a equivalent of such a device , but he didn &apos;t require contact for the second to be more .
- And it &apos;s not necessary to increase the cameras number ?
- The Kin@@ ec@@ t has now three &quot; cameras , one of which is in fact the under@@ cover of the under@@ cover and the second reception of the signal reflected . &quot;
but the third camera is actually a simple sens@@ or of visible di@@ ap@@ as@@ ons .
this isn &apos;t used to determine the depth of the object .
potentially , more of cameras could solve the problem ...
or on the contrary , increase it and get the number of re@@ plic@@ ating .
it would be good to create a flexible analy@@ st of Kin@@ ec@@ t , playing with the cur@@ v@@ ature of location and see how this would help determine the tri@@ dimensional position .
- So I remember , Micro@@ soft , unlike Google , he hasn &apos;t introduced his glasses to the public .
don &apos;t you think that , since the point of a reality of reality technology increases , the glasses are one of the most most visible platforms ?
- Of course , spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands , it &apos;s not very comfortable , but I think :
glasses are very personal devices , that &apos;s his strength .
- Let &apos;s imagine for a moment that the underground objects in the air are available not only for Tony Star@@ k of the film , but also for any simple mortal .
there &apos;s a problem in this idea that critics usually point out , no tac@@ tile answer !
hands don &apos;t feel anything !
what answers is your group ready for this challenge ?
- In my lec@@ tures often I say reality is the seventh @-@ rup@@ tion in the interaction between the man and the machine .
I think the eigh@@ th is well @-@ well could be the degree of tac@@ tical sens@@ ation .
meanwhile , one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand for the image .
all right .
but they exist as well as they &apos;re really in the air to bring into the air .
there &apos;s also pul@@ ser@@ ent to the doll that you influence in nervous fin@@ als , this is also a promising address .
- Have you tried to fool the brain ?
do you think that he feels like I should feel in the moment he sees something ?
- That &apos;s a good idea , we haven &apos;t tried yet .
here &apos;s another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time , how to make a physically cut in a very short space believe that you &apos;re going to an open space , almost un@@ finished .
for now , fool the brain doesn &apos;t get so easy , we still need to work for a lot of years .
that &apos;s what makes the job attractive to the virtual reality for investig@@ ators , which many things find in a state of total conception .
- Nice to meet you .

in this list of best people find the art of art and the scene of San Peters@@ burg , whose achievements are beyond town , often find recognition in Europe without Russia even .
the new hero of &quot; Ros@@ bal@@ t &apos;s &quot; is the ex@@ trav@@ el@@ ant artist .
the whole city knows Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller , a bar@@ bu@@ do man from red up down , which can be found near the Mu@@ se@@ o R@@ us@@ o , near the Ver@@ ano de Ver@@ ano or meeting .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller &apos;s pa@@ int@@ ings always attr@@ acts multi@@ distinc@@ tive , wherever he was exposed .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller is one of those purely socio @-@ psy@@ ch@@ ons of San Peters@@ burg , new mi@@ to@@ log@@ s .
Ki@@ ri@@ ll Miller is a brilliant sign of San Peters@@ burg &apos;s .
besides , it &apos;s a urban man , whose appearance in the streets of town wake up in the globe and lift all the state of mood .
recently , he took in his hands a ship@@ ment and turned into San Peters@@ burg &apos;s organis@@ m , since he has grown up to make so hard , for his existence , his philosophy and his image .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , why are you going to the city of red and yellow , not yellow , for example ?
- I had the red color because I &apos;m a fashion desig@@ ner and I &apos;m stopping the sight and the image .
in this world , red color is a commitment between the artist , cre@@ ators and society .
even though in society , everything that isn &apos;t a little gr@@ in@@ ity , it &apos;s un@@ armed and sp@@ in@@ ning of property .
but my trou@@ bles are addressed to a conversation .
all the history of my creative actions are an invitation to debate .
- When did you understand that you should be an artist ?
- In a story of the W@@ ev@@ sky Pal@@ ace , where my jobs were shown .
I realized that was my way .
then the wave of old artists didn &apos;t end up , and the new , free as me , were still un@@ understood .
I made a friend of artists from the new wave , with the next ones they were exposed in Gaza and N@@ ev@@ ski@@ sk@@ aya , which took &quot; P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ aya @-@ 10 , &quot; and it &apos;s over the new wave .
I joined the the@@ ater in the la@@ und@@ ry , the music of everyone , but not the letters .
- And all this got together in your art C@@ liquid ... for me was important to find myself in the cultural center of San Peters@@ burg , where the best creative minds were .
in 1995 , I had a territory in P@@ ush@@ kin@@ sk@@ aya @-@ 10 and there , while I had no reforms , he existed a musical club , a wedding club , a wedding club , the house of San Peters@@ burg &apos;s wedding .
many were born there , N@@ oms , T@@ equi@@ la J@@ az@@ z , remember the way that Lanc@@ ur brought the project to Van Go@@ gh &apos;s project .
Mar@@ ur and his friends san@@ g up songs under the plu@@ mb@@ ing , they were filled with tight pants , among them was the usual fashion V@@ do@@ vin V@@ do@@ vin .
when the group started playing alive , he became &quot; Len@@ ing@@ ine . &quot;
Tr@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg was a lot of a lot of program@@ s before H@@ ali @-@ g@@ ali@@ v@@ ate .
we gave Tr@@ ach@@ ten@@ berg and was the beginning of your great career , basic education and training received it from us .
gallery &quot; D Lee , &quot; the Gri@@ dian Club , they are the remains of the Ar@@ te of Ar@@ te .
there they go our employees and customers .
I &apos;m a hero &apos;s hero , when culture meant something .
in the year 2000 , the studio was made in the press , the prize was &quot; The people of our city . &quot;
in the nomination &quot; Ar@@ stic Year &quot; was elected me , that ended my culmin@@ ation .
in these new times it &apos;s not comfortable to work ; I &apos;m a man who likes the truth , honesty and culture .
in our time it &apos;s easy to be popular , but culture and popu@@ lar@@ ity will go apart .
- There &apos;s something recogni@@ zing .
- How many of my pa@@ int@@ ings are , they are clearly the current and the show .
I &apos;m going to make a scheduled exposure , &quot; The Mu@@ se@@ o R@@ us@@ o . &quot;
the clo@@ bles are a match .
I was soci@@ able , but now being so painful and scary .
but in the c@@ low@@ ns everything gets drunk and the tragedy is eliminated .
I love the rude , I &apos;ve got some rude thoughts .
for example , the salv@@ ation of the world by a federal and mandatory change of clothing .
now you &apos;re still in the la@@ und@@ ry , based on the outside , but not inside the inside of the person .
and , maybe that person shouldn &apos;t even give her hand , but sp@@ it him in his face .
and dece@@ it will be removed when you change your clothes .
- Well , we &apos;ve seen you in the urban organiz@@ ill@@ ero paper .
who better than me to be !
- Well , maybe commercial art can be b@@ ello ?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous , sweet , having t@@ act .
we &apos;re being witnesses of dis@@ integration .
in the first place , people were in man@@ ped , the balls wanted a thing , the songs .
now they all split up in micro@@ communities , it &apos;s hard to eat everyone .
I &apos;m not a $ 100 bill to like you all .
now we need to think who you want .
now , every hero &apos;s hero has their 100 fans .
- And to listen to St@@ as Mik@@ ha@@ i@@ lov they come for thousands !
- You &apos;re gonna see the abandoned , it works the social @-@ social sphere .
and a cultural event will go 300 people , 10 grand .
I have my fans , most important is not cheating , not losing what you &apos;ve done .
when I was young I did such a pa@@ int@@ er that a collec@@ tor had in the wall of Fal@@ k and L@@ ari@@ on@@ ov .
I started pa@@ int@@ ings , with which people usually finish .
now you often confuse the concepts .
they say spiritual culture , consumption culture .
there &apos;s no culture in consumption , that &apos;s another story .
I &apos;m a man of culture yesterday , I grew up under the example of artists that lived in poverty and died in poverty , they were denied to the money just to paint blocks .
I &apos;m in favour of this culture .
- Ki@@ ri@@ ll , what &apos;s wrong with San Peters@@ burg ?
- Good experts in culture .
there &apos;s a concept of culture .
but not all they can get to culture .
when the s@@ ings were the right things , it was a different way , the ro@@ ings maybe I didn &apos;t buy the culture very well , but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts .
in Moscow now there &apos;s very good consul@@ tors .
we have people in San Peters@@ burg that might be experts , but they &apos;re closed , because they need experts to a higher level than to evaluate these and open their way .
now he &apos;s thri@@ lling the personal taste .
the same thing Er@@ ar@@ ta , but the difference is that they say not all modern art is accepted , there are some artists that have to search for other muse@@ ums .
- What &apos;s for you San Peters@@ burg ?
- San Peters@@ burg &apos;s not a cultural capital .
but about our rocks is hard that art grows .
we need cultural ground and we have now more writing than read@@ ers , this is wrong .
in Europe there &apos;s a lot of people in curi@@ osity that he &apos;s gonna ex@@ position and con@@ certain .
in our case , this class is unique .
we have to make art , like it was at the end of the last century .
the project will be executed with a San Peters@@ burg grant .
give birth in space
Earth &apos;s in danger .
global warming or shock with an aster@@ o@@ id .
fil@@ thy ships with human beings on board to search for a search planet .
to maintain humanity &apos;s question is the main question , how to continue the species in fr@@ ra@@ vi@@ dity or the same planet in re@@ tress ?
I think there &apos;s little to choose .
in fact , two are real plan@@ ets that can be colon@@ iz@@ ed , at least hypo@@ the@@ tically hypo@@ the@@ tically .
&quot; these are Ven@@ us and Mar@@ s , &quot; says the chief investig@@ ator from the State Institute , S@@ tern@@ berg P.@@ K. .
but if the conditions in Mar@@ s are better for life , in Ven@@ us &apos;s surface , it &apos;s 500 degrees .
you can only live to big al@@ titu@@ des or in Ven@@ us &apos;s or@@ bit ... in space .
he started to deal with the co@@ aches in space with flora .
he &apos;s done a half a century .
four generations of gu@@ ts cultiv@@ ated in or@@ bit , they didn &apos;t differ in any of the surface vari@@ eties .
then he came up with insec@@ ts in the or@@ bit , little flies in fruit , dru@@ ms .
in 1979 they sent into the toilet room to check out how the surface is .
we get like a normal ch@@ ick .
but then they start the trouble .
&quot; the problem is that this baby has to find support , must remain above their own and start moving &quot; , &quot; it explains Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ ch@@ ev , the director of the D@@ P@@ B@@ M Institute .
you don &apos;t find support , the d@@ ats used to fly vol@@ ter@@ ets at random .
and after 10 hours in the new@@ est , he gave a total total total of inst@@ inc@@ ts .
the girls didn &apos;t react to the light or sound .
and the mis@@ fortune was that after four days just died .
&quot; and twice we get the girls to be born , but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them , &quot; com@@ ing Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ ch@@ ev over failure . &quot;
the last time a mini@@ ar@@ ca &quot; biological &quot; came to the or@@ bit was 16 years ago .
in the spring of 2013 they will continue the experiments .
however , in the bi@@ os@@ at@@ elite &quot; Bi@@ on will only travel species from a same sex . &quot;
there was a r@@ ats with r@@ ats , they were sent into space with ugly .
in principle , you didn &apos;t find any super@@ natural .
&quot; this was precisely the bi@@ os@@ at@@ é@@ ur , but this was a unique experiment , and studies like this must be taken off , &quot; ate Vladi@@ mir Sy@@ ch@@ ev . &quot;
after landing , the space r@@ ats had off@@ ended .
however , he still hasn &apos;t gotten the problem in the building directly in space .
it &apos;s a hard challenge .
animals , losing their usual habit@@ at , they just can &apos;t do their sexual inst@@ inct .
the man , however , unlike the little animals , in principle , can .
Hom@@ er s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens has the abstr@@ act reasoning and he &apos;s capable of creating an emotional fund .
similar experiments don &apos;t get through ethical reasons .
but women travel in space for 50 years .
the greatest risk was done by Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va .
and the most beautiful thing that humanity has is the female organis@@ m .
our gu@@ m fly , and nobody in Earth could say , if it &apos;s after a flight .
he can or not have a baby after this flight .
&quot; after all , this question has no one answered , eat the v@@ ault of the V@@ akh@@ tan@@ g V@@ ach@@ swimming sector .
in June of 196@@ 4 , only after a year of flight to space , the first woman tic@@ mon@@ au@@ ta , Valent@@ ine Ter@@ es@@ h@@ ko@@ va , gave birth to a daughter .
dad &apos;s dad , An@@ dri@@ an Nik@@ ol@@ ay@@ ev , was also tic@@ mon@@ au@@ ta .
in 1988 , the second woman tic@@ mon@@ au@@ ta , S@@ ve@@ t@@ l@@ ana Sav@@ it@@ sk@@ aya , who twice was in or@@ bit and even worked in open space , had a son .
however , the risk persist@@ s .
we &apos;re a few people , they &apos;re told the astron@@ au@@ ts after long flights , and a healthy generation comes growing up .
&quot; and if you can say more , it &apos;s dangerous even in or@@ lic@@ al flights , &quot; it sums the pilot tic@@ mon@@ au@@ ta , hero of the Soviet Union , hero of Russia , Val@@ ery Pol@@ y@@ ak@@ ov .
however , humanity must find some new ways in biotechnology , on radi@@ ological protection , the creation of artificial gravity .
the C@@ enter of the C@@ enter is a mandatory phase in preparation for flight .
in conditions of nu@@ t@@ ability , the tic@@ mon@@ au@@ ts practice their work skills in space .
the water &apos;s ra@@ ining .
if for an adult the water is a comfortable environment , even though he still hostile , for a kid simply born his native element .
the little men @-@ in @-@ dark men seem to confirm that life in the ground came from the ocean .
there &apos;s a connection between the fact that the baby would find approximately 9 months inside his mother in the am@@ ile , so it will be easier used to water .
in principle , this is logical , because since the moment of the first bathroom they spend only two weeks .
&quot; this is so little to forget something , &quot; he says Marina Ak@@ sen@@ o@@ va , monitor of swimming swimming .
in short , if the vi@@ vi@@ dity is a natural state for a new@@ born , for women is necessary , the gravity of gravity .
in soli@@ vi@@ ity , the mus@@ cle mus@@ cle and the pel@@ vis are dec@@ rep@@ ously re@@ plic@@ ated , the ability to dis@@ appoint it .
well , we left that , confess in the promotion of stimul@@ ants for birth .
you can , of course , give birth in a special camera , this will push it .
&quot; and then what ? &quot;
otherwise , the kid needs artificial gravity .
without the feeling of gravity , the organis@@ m doesn &apos;t create sk@@ el@@ et@@ el or the mus@@ cle system .
a new@@ born in or@@ bit is impossible to dress it with a special suit for training , like adults .
he &apos;s just gonna get rid of what he &apos;s vital for him .
&quot; and this experiment that we &apos;re going to do together , allow the birth of a child in a strange environment , will take place to bring the Earth into a disability , a fully in@@ adapted person , which is an entirely un@@ adap@@ ted person , &quot; an entirely in@@ adap@@ ted person . &quot;
for now , the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter .
however , with time this will be a reality , when human beings in their ships are headed to a distant planet that will be home for their kids born in space .
chief of N@@ K@@ ynn :
in public foster matter , the Czech Republic counts with good inspectors and quality legislation , even though their execution .
like Mi@@ los@@ lav K@@ ala , vice president of the Supreme Control Office .
&quot; law will never be perfect , but its application must be correct . &quot;
the official controls of the Czech and Germans are also coming to similar conclusions .
as example of a wrong practice , he mentioned Pe@@ derman Ne@@ om@@ as &apos;s attitude to the system of being independent only on the role , which knows how the system is .
the Prime Minister has recently said the O@@ DS .
&quot; the law must be regulated somehow and if you ban something , in that case , or the president of the government can stop the performance of the office that has the obligation to perform those controls , and demand K@@ ala . &quot;
in the committee &apos;s control meeting in the House , you spoke of the common project between the Czech team and the German , in the framework of which the law was compared to public procurement in both countries .
what exactly is it ?
this is a parallel control that we started to perform a few years ago .
in a simpli@@ fied way , European law laws are supposed to be organiz@@ ed by public enforcement , this is still the current legislation in every country and then the practice in itself .
we &apos;ve joined everything and , even though control hasn &apos;t finished , we &apos;ve got very interesting differences , usually , the legislation of our country is more strict in Germany .
it confirms , well , that &apos;s not enough to incorporate rules every time more strict , but it &apos;s necessary to focus on the application of the law itself .
what can you actually do this project ?
precisely a common control of this guy could contribute to that we leave to invest in the concrete of the laws , the reduction and improvement of the boundaries , even though this isn &apos;t such a positive impact .
the economy economy means to get a fair thing to a reasonable price .
but not the fact of reducing the limits of the delivery , means we &apos;re going to get it .
maybe because the system is .
you talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the laws governing public practice .
how does the control system work in Germany ?
is it a similar office to our N@@ K@@ ynn or protect other way ?
in how many offices , as the N@@ K@@ ynn , there is the Bun@@ dis@@ tr@@ l@@ sh@@ it@@ g@@ sh@@ sh@@ it@@ g@@ sh@@ sh@@ de of the Federal Court , with a similar organization to ours , with a similar school , too , but in principle both evol@@ ving in the way .
also the powers are to certain analy@@ sts , however , as Germany has a federal organization , the courts of accounts find this level .
the Federal Court of Auditors can only control federal money , which here we call State funds .
public funds , which are administered by the regions and the bodies , there in Germany , in Germany , they &apos;re controlling the Federal Court of Auditors .
as for local legislation , is it easier than ours ?
usually , I &apos;d like to establish a comparison without concrete data .
could you be better , for example , as for the quality of the inspectors ?
I &apos;m sure not , but , repeat , I don &apos;t like to do this kind of comparison .
it &apos;s necessary to say that even those countries we take as a model must make a big deal .
if it wasn &apos;t like that , it wouldn &apos;t be any benefit to collabor@@ ate with our office , don &apos;t you think ?
as for the laws of our country , what did you mean for your office in law enforcement ?
considering that the validity of this amendment is relatively short , yet he hasn &apos;t shown up in control of control .
since we made ex @-@ post controls , I need to count on a certain delay .
for now , you look at the process of preparing for future controls , we &apos;ve started a new tool of risk detection , for which we &apos;ve been through almost 14@@ ,000 public cases , which have been analy@@ zed by the way , which has been analy@@ zed .
do you think the approval of this law is beneficial or that , rather , it &apos;s a mess for the bureaucratic system ?
I think this law is probably a step in the right direction and I hope that way .
the problem that can arise is that the rules are bl@@ essed and impossible to be done .
with the previous regulations , the controlled people were linked to the contr@@ actor .
does it make any sense then to shake the law in this way ?
I think not this way .
the system must exclude those who want to attack him or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal failure , which has no effect on the decisions .
a system of this guy will only get a greater bureaucratic pressure .
and how do you get out of this ?
we &apos;ll see where we get this way started .
the Prime Minister has recently declared that the O@@ DS wouldn &apos;t bother the business@@ men in the called a revolutionary system , referred to the fact of being independent .
is it forbidden or allowed ?
the law must be regulated somehow and , if you ban something , then not even the Prime Minister can stop the performance of the Office that has the obligation to perform those controls and demand obligations .
I mean , &quot; We changed the law and we allow it , &quot; but he can &apos;t say that we will do it as if nothing .
in law enforcement , the rules are fairly strict as far as the way it must be formally acted .
but on the other hand , it &apos;s tragic that the candidate will be excluded by the best offer for not fulfilling formal demands .
the law will never be perfect , but its application must be correct , this is , in my opinion , what we need .
the roads present ice pl@@ ates , even though in most of them they are expensive .
in several places of the Czech Republic , the roads are present and snow .
even though most of the tracks are expensive , in some of you must be the precau@@ tion .
Kar@@ lov@@ y V@@ ary region
today the roads in the Kar@@ lov@@ y region and V@@ ary were transi@@ table , but they had ice pl@@ ates and snow .
the sub@@ ci@@ se , and he &apos;ll be dark between five and ten degrees under zero .
he stopped ne@@ wing in the region and in the la@@ und@@ ry areas is fin@@ ely .
in exchange , in the sk@@ ir@@ ts of the Met@@ á@@ lic@@ s , it &apos;s almost 30 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters .
in some places the visibility was still bad because of the nest of the control control center .
the fast R@@ 6 and the first @-@ class road in the region are now transi@@ table without restrictions .
however , it &apos;s strongly recommended the precau@@ tion , especially in some bridges whose surface can be frozen and sli@@ de .
also , they &apos;re also transi@@ table all the second and third category , including mountain roads .
however , in some of them there &apos;s still some kind of ice and snow .
we need to raise attention in the road , especially in the highest areas .
region of Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice and H@@ r@@ illy
in some Eastern Bo@@ hem@@ ia roads , there &apos;s danger of ice cream and in higher areas and in the mountains can have formed a snow of snow in the tracks , reported their pages of the roads and high@@ roads .
the operating oper@@ aries warn the drivers about the danger of the danger of ice form@@ alities , especially in higher areas of the Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice region .
they can take ice cream in Lan@@ š@@ k@@ ro@@ un &apos;s first place , and I used to be n@@ ad Or@@ lic@@ ky , Poli@@ ry@@ ky , S@@ vit@@ av or V@@ y@@ so@@ k@@ é@@ ho , and especially on the second @-@ class roads .
the roads .
there &apos;s snow especially on the roads in Kr@@ k@@ on@@ o@@ š@@ e &apos;s mountains .
there &apos;s a fr@@ actu@@ ous snow layer in the highest roads in Ry@@ ch@@ shire &apos;s bodies in Ry@@ ch@@ shire n@@ ad K@@ n@@ apo .
in the Eastern Bo@@ hem@@ ia in the East Bo@@ hem@@ ia , the sky will be between clear and partially clou@@ dy , without rush .
dark temper@@ atures will usually between three under zero and a positive degree , will be a weak wind .
Pil@@ sen region
the roads in Pil@@ sen &apos;s region are expensive today by tomorrow , even though he &apos;ll have to take care of caution and need to be adapted at time .
in the first hours of tomorrow there will be stars , the dark temper@@ atures will be between three and nine degrees under zero .
after the ne@@ v@@ ade and behind the bottom of temper@@ atures , some tracks could also be covered in ice .
in some places , drivers will find you with ni@@ g , but visibility will be gradually improved .
this is what shows out the information of the operating control centre .
the D@@ 5 is temporary .
the surface of most first @-@ degree roads is dry and without ice .
in Pil@@ sen &apos;s road zone and T@@ ac@@ ho@@ v border with Germany , we could have set up with ice pl@@ ates .
the second and third category are wet , so , in this case , he also warned you of tr@@ aces .
drivers should be more cautious , especially in the less transitional tracks in the But@@ u@@ ma@@ va area .
Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region
the drivers who are headed into the highest areas in the Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c region will find a radical snow .
after the chemical treatment , he was still snow in the har@@ ness of J@@ ide@@ ven@@ o@@ bu , and in the way to V@@ ide@@ l@@ sk@@ eva &apos;s .
the road oper@@ ates took off the snow during the night , in Cap@@ um@@ per &apos;s high@@ way .
in the rest of the region , most forms are expensive without restrictions .
&quot; in the highest areas of Mont@@ um@@ per &apos;s road , remains of snow . &quot;
the drivers in the har@@ ness of Gonz@@ er@@ ven@@ o@@ o@@ é will be found with a half @-@ sk@@ ir@@ t .
on the ground and night they came to the Jes@@ en@@ ick@@ en , too , and after the chemical treatment , the main lines are now clear and wet .
in Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c &apos;s high@@ way , the tracks are expensive without restrictions , in Cap@@ tern@@ ber@@ sk@@ ah &apos;s drivers should drive the drivers in the woods , where the tracks are still wet .
♪ I &apos;ve been born to the country ♪
the northern roads of the North Bo@@ hem@@ ia have reported about complic@@ ations in different tr@@ aces we were at first time .
apart from some places he has ne@@ v@@ ed or ice cream , according to the police database the road of the mountain between Tel@@ nice and K@@ nic@@ Nice in the war@@ ehouse .
the temper@@ atures keep under zero , even in the lower areas , so the ice and snow are obviously staying in cal@@ ly , especially in the shor@@ est area , especially in the sou@@ th@@ west , especially in the sou@@ th@@ west .
because of the m@@ align@@ ment they haven &apos;t been charged .
the road operators have been at the ice presence in the first place of Cap@@ t@@ lyn you .
according to the mete@@ or , the conditions have been ideal for night .
since the general roads have been announced conditions in the road I / 13 , in the border between the region of the country .
the road between Tel@@ nice and K@@ nic@@ Nice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that they had on the edge of the snow .
Cap@@ im@@ on Or@@ nest : in our con@@ certain we want to build positive energy
you say in less than a month is gonna get the end of the world , what do you think about it ?
it &apos;s just one of the other news to get us to catch us .
to the music group , The T@@ ap T@@ ap &apos;s more like to make jo@@ kes about this and we like to say that we &apos;re the only group of music to postpone the end of the world or to stop it .
besides , in December you have a really original project , three con@@ certain against the end of the world .
can you explain to our read@@ ers ?
it &apos;s about a state act that we &apos;ve been planning for two years .
we decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the ma@@ ya @-@ based calendar .
the day before , December 20 to 21 hours , we will arrange three Con@@ certain Con@@ certain Con@@ certain , Br@@ ni and O@@ str@@ ava .
you &apos;ll end up at the same time in which you finish the ma@@ ya on the Ki@@ ri@@ b@@ ati Island in the Ki@@ ri@@ b@@ ati Island , 12 hours ahead of our area .
who did this idea ?
originally was my idea , then we were for@@ ging the whole project together with our Hon@@ za design desig@@ ner .
besides wanting enough energy and avoiding the end of the world , we also want to reflect , along with society , about the state we will leave our kids .
with the end of the final calendar , we &apos;ve also created a unique collection of items : bott@@ les , shir@@ ts , bags and original cri@@ es against the end of the world they can take in w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ and @-@ cover , another way to support us .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap Group , along with other interpreters , he also san@@ g the name of the world , which has taken by title &quot; The world , cancel@@ ed . &quot;
he &apos;s currently very popular in Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , can you hear in the coun@@ sel@@ es ?
of course I do , and it &apos;ll be just the last , well , as long as everything goes well and not finished the world ...
they &apos;ll sing all the interpreters at the same time in three con@@ certain .
the an@@ us will go between themselves and thank the special re@@ transmission in the Czech vision .
Tom@@ á@@ k Han@@ á@@ k wrote the letter of this song and interpret the leading role of Jesus at the video , where he also cri@@ es X@@ ind@@ l X ...
how did this collaboration come up ?
we work together with other person@@ alities of the Czech cultural scene , apart from organiz@@ ing a lot of bl@@ ings and con@@ certain .
we put all our hopes to participate in this project .
he &apos;s proven most of them interested in working with us .
what will the money raise in the Coun@@ ty against the end of the world ?
to equipment for the education centre without Christian barriers , which we &apos;re headed for at its sixth year consecu@@ tive year with the civil association in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ aul .
J@@ ed@@ li@@ l@@ k@@ aul &apos;s school students are regularly meeting the visi@@ tor &apos;s visit with which they do fun and interesting activities .
the students don &apos;t have enough financial means to pay for teachers and make a li@@ mb to make it possible .
in the fin@@ al of work in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ aul , he will exist an independent building which we will transfer to this project .
in every concert they act several groups and interpreters .
what are the selection criteria ?
we tried to work a programme that is attractive to all generations , including children .
for example , in Prague , they will be here in Prague , Sup@@ port , Star@@ bi@@ ens , I@@ ll@@ us@@ tries to get up with Dan B@@ lum@@ ta , The T@@ ap T@@ ap , Mari@@ an Ban@@ go and Ji@@ hr@@ h@@ lum .
to get some more detailed information , you can consult w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ k@@ w@@ k@@ .@@ cz@@ .
you have any other spectacular action in the future ?
in May we will be first in the first time in the P@@ ra@@ ž@@ sk@@ é , so here we will probably prepare a thri@@ lled with interesting guests .
next year we &apos;d also like to play in the National Hall of New York and me , personally , advantage that we &apos;re in America , I &apos;d like to fill it out in Washington and Chicago .
your plans abroad aren &apos;t exactly minimal , so far you have acted for example in Madrid , Brussels , London or Moscow .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap is , however , a group of people with disability .
how &apos;s the logistics and the organization of these journeys ?
it &apos;s not so hard to see the first sight .
there &apos;s five members in a whe@@ el@@ chair .
however , so far we &apos;ve arranged well .
even in Moscow , where we &apos;ve come back recently ago , he went out of everything .
thank you .
what did you find you till now ?
in Madrid , Luxembourg , London and other towns , it works better than here in Russia we &apos;ve been witnesses to go .
unlike Prague , Moscow &apos;s full of barriers , there is still without being frequent that a person dis@@ charged by the center of the city in an electric whe@@ el@@ chair .
something as ordinary as it is , for example , give a whe@@ el@@ chair in whe@@ els in whe@@ els , there it is not .
luc@@ ki@@ ly , a civilian association has been created for fear of fear of people with disability .
what are we supposed to have an example of more advanced countries ?
there are many things that we &apos;re going through ...
but it &apos;s important to mention that perfec@@ ting and improving the situation always depends on people who affect directly .
in London and Madrid , it &apos;s very normal that people with a serious disability dis@@ pose for their public account and can go to the service , where they want ...
but it &apos;s not very common that a great number of people with disability to participate in social life actively , in this look , with The T@@ ap T@@ ap .
a society respec@@ table without barriers is a thing , but when the moment you get on the way you are famous sports , artists , actors , politicians , politicians .
until now , they are isolated cases of people who have a great force force .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap is currently very popular , but if we look after a few years , what took you to the group in 1998 ?
I came into J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ aul &apos;s .
and since I &apos;m a musi@@ cian , toast , between others , the sa@@ x@@ op@@ al , based a group with a working partner .
and at the time , like our hum@@ our L@@ á@@ ec says to An@@ gel@@ ovi@@ ov , we were a bit of hands .
however , the popu@@ lar@@ ity didn &apos;t get to these last years , or am I wrong ?
it &apos;s true that he helped us quite the fact of connec@@ ting with famous singer and also working actively to promote the group .
we get to the conclusion that the work that doesn &apos;t look like , it &apos;s like I don &apos;t exist .
thank you .
you wanted to get so far with The T@@ ap T@@ ap ?
since the beginning I saw the potential I had , you can do something else .
the world &apos;s world is full of things that look like the others .
it &apos;s logical , in its way , all the new thing to be careful and long time in accepting .
there &apos;s a few extraordinary things , but I dare say that The T@@ ap T@@ ap is one of them .
the impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly com@@ passion , it &apos;s a natural reaction ...
but com@@ passion is totally superfluous because people with disability are not abandoned beings who suffer and that we should have com@@ passion .
there are people who are capable of living a full life and develop , with the condition , of course you have the means of the media .
I &apos;m always saying that if something gets out with disability , then it &apos;s not just a breakthrough for them , but for all society .
did you help the fact that you &apos;re a permanent chief , like you described a lot of people ?
if we want to do a quality job , we have to be strict in many ways and demand certain discipline .
I think it &apos;s completely normal .
some people come up with a romantic vision and the head in the clou@@ ds and when they get out that they have to go two days to rehear@@ se , go to the test test and have a lot of time trav@@ eling in the first time .
but that &apos;s how it works everywhere , in every group who wants to work and get something .
the T@@ ap T@@ ap is currently 20 members .
how many of them were in the next year ?
just one :
we &apos;re a group open , people get in and get out , can &apos;t help it .
who have a will and win will always find the door open
it &apos;ll be the day before the end of the world , Thursday 20@@ .@@ 12.@@ 2012
you &apos;ll have a place in the In@@ ch@@ ate A@@ ren@@ a , in Fl@@ é@@ da de Br@@ no and Pl@@ y@@ no@@ j@@ em in O@@ str@@ ava and will participate in O@@ str@@ ava
the three cities will be connected to the end of the evening through video video to sing together .
the goal of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance multi @-@ functional operational equipment in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ aul in J@@ ed@@ li@@ č@@ k@@ aul &apos;s .
the entrance to the concert costs 400 C@@ Z@@ K and children until 12 years they have free entry in the sale of sale in Bo@@ h@@ emi@@ ati@@ c .
Poland and the harvest .
in the meeting of the European Space Agency last week , he agreed to Poland as a du@@ o@@ tenth member of the former Eastern European Federation .
Poland began an intense collaboration with the Bureau in the next year , and during the next time he was involved in the Committee of projects .
however , the path of Poland towards the harvest began much before .
the Poles are already devoted to the flights in space before the Second World War , even though I didn &apos;t always know their work .
I remember , for instance , the A.@@ C. conference conference in Var@@ so@@ via &apos;s astron@@ gin@@ ary observ@@ atory which , of December December 19@@ 33 , introduced their ideas on the pion@@ eering study . &quot;
the young eng@@ in@@ eer eng@@ in@@ eer .
in 19@@ 34 , 19@@ 34 P.@@ R.
Dr. Jan G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski .
he published hundreds of items in pol@@ normal magaz@@ ines and wrote a series of dedicated books to this scientific discipline .
G@@ ad@@ om@@ ski became a promotion of the tic@@ mon@@ au@@ tica , he was known in the whole world and his contribution to science was re@@ warded when his name was made to one of the hidden face of the moon .
in the 19@@ 25 year , he was built in Poland .
unfortunately , he dis@@ knows who the author of the proposal was , and they don &apos;t know the mo@@ al@@ les of the project .
it &apos;s not clear if the co@@ he@@ te was gonna be used for the le@@ ather or for his slow@@ ing .
the information about this angel is limited to the press in the press .
from the year 19@@ 33 the Polish arti@@ ll@@ ery began to go to the mis@@ siles .
the investigation was financed by K@@ om@@ or@@ ka Tech@@ ni@@ ki U@@ z@@ bro@@ j@@ ine in collaboration with the pro@@ f .
from the for@@ ged material , it makes it clear that research came into the line of evidence .
however , with the arrival of German troops , he broke the investigation .
in 19@@ 37 , 19@@ 37 showed up in the specialist of a photo@@ electrical hunting missile designed by the eng@@ in@@ eer Ro@@ ho@@ zi@@ de and next year was published the studio R@@ ak@@ i@@ eta .
both projects were meant to the military use for the mis@@ siles .
little before the war , the scientific committee the provisional committee .
the committee was founded in 19@@ 37 , but after two years of activity , he was interrupted by the beginning of the war .
other research studies .
in November 19@@ 54 &apos;s Day , the Pro@@ bl@@ emy is referred to by the first time to society with four very extensive items .
in one of them , the pro@@ f .
in that time , you had to put satellite projects and it was obvious that the co@@ smi@@ c investigation was an discipline with future prospects .
since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of astron@@ au@@ tic astron@@ au@@ tica was trying to form part of the International State of astron@@ au@@ tics .
next year the first president of the P@@ TA , Kaz@@ imit@@ er@@ z Z@@ ar@@ an@@ z Z@@ ar@@ an@@ ki@@ ew@@ ic@@ z .
he played this charge until his death in 19@@ 59 .
from the 1956 , the P@@ TA was significant in the development of R@@ M .
the first guy R@@ M @-@ 1 was finished in 19@@ 57 and turned up for the first time of 19@@ 58 .
the co@@ he@@ te had a $ 1,@@ 800 .
later , it &apos;s over to build the R@@ M @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1
the co@@ he@@ te &apos;s $ 1,@@ 4 .
another type of co@@ he@@ te in development was gonna be a real scientific study .
however , in 196@@ 2 , the jobs were suspended .
the Grand R@@ M &apos;s successor was the Met@@ e@@ te @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 19@@ 65 .
he was designed like a two @-@ stage co@@ he@@ te , with a total length of 5@@ 10 c@@ m and an initial weight of 3@@ 2.@@ 5 .
they developed three guys .
in Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1
the top on three guys was 37 miles .
between the 19@@ 65 and 196@@ 8 developed in the Air Institute ...
the Met@@ e@@ ator @-@ 2 had an initial weight of 3@@ 80 pounds and he was able to take a useful advantage of 10 pounds to 60 miles from high .
then the Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 2@@ h version was built and Met@@ e@@ or @-@ 3 .
it &apos;s necessary to mention the entrance of Poland at CO@@ SA .
in the context of the Inter@@ k@@ os@@ ms programme , Poland joined the research investigation on artificial satel@@ lites and , in 197@@ 8 , the Polish pilot , the Po@@ ck@@ law Her@@ mas@@ z@@ ew@@ ski ...
the suspension of social law is not the solution .
last week the constitutional cour@@ thou@@ se was suspended the social law .
the resolution woke up a heated argument in society .
of course it &apos;ll be interesting to examine the problems from a wider view .
the liberal economic systems in the EU , as in the globalised world , are based on the beginning of a major economic and less competition .
therefore , this means the different economic ways and national economic systems are in permanent conflict between themselves .
cause is in the beginning of free trade and the free and ili@@ tless move of private capital , along with financial speculation .
the effect of the big differences in labour cost .
under this concept , you need to understand the situation that the manufacturer , with the import of cheap goods , try to shor@@ ter distances and for it &quot; cause a price of the competition with the most part of the market and , &quot; so , increase your profit margin . &quot;
great scale means , for most business@@ sters , transfer the production abroad , buying there more cheap@@ est or well away .
because private capital has no social responsibility one and , with it , it &apos;s not responsible for unemployment that this phenomenon creates , necessarily the social expense of the state .
this entire situation is the total interest of employers for paying taxes and increase the economic and social damage that they &apos;ve caused in their pursuit of profit .
the situation is universally so unknown that we don &apos;t have to file specific statistical data .
the un@@ scrupulous practices of private capital create situations , in certain economies , in which the governments of those countries are being forced to compete with the target of reducing themselves into the social reduction in the country .
said another way , governments get private capital to their own population without considering the social decline .
this is all right about the changes in the laws of existing laws .
target is to force the population to accept the private capital of private capital , especially as far as the wages .
this has a place , by a part , by the financial obligation system in the long @-@ term unemployment case , by the way , by the restricted rights of workers as for labour rights .
the result is an increasing poverty with the increase of differences between the poor and rich .
since a series of years , they exist in Germany .
the number of people who get this kind of help is coming to a million .
in the creation of the economy increase in the German economy , there is a pretty frequent case , people employed with such a low salary as the state must pay the rest to survive .
he became public a scandal of this type related to the German National House &apos;s aid situation .
the savings of practically all the southern states in the European Union leads , no place to doubt , to the same situation , people , pressure for an ab@@ mis@@ ous decline in their social levels , are they being forced to emigr@@ ate as in the 19@@ th century .
is it necessary to ask where he comes from ?
in case you &apos;re dealing with other countries in the European Union , then poverty comes from a country to another or not it ever comes , since Chinese , Indians , Sou@@ si@@ le@@ ents , Turks , Moroccan or Afr@@ icans are still working for a part of European salary .
this is also affecting America .
the liberal the@@ ories and the media claim to the s@@ aci@@ e that the state should not provide capital to the economy , to run the economy .
private capital def@@ ends with n@@ ails and teeth that the state should not intervene in the med@@ dling in control .
next , you need to wonder if private capital doesn &apos;t affect your selfish ego@@ ism and , by the way , in the entire state .
the answer is clearly affirm@@ ative .
the test is the existence of lobbying , in very powerful practice and om@@ ni@@ present , all states .
the result is a desperate situation that manif@@ ts in the field of corruption , in mutual fav@@ ors , in the mutual legislation , which is practically re@@ unlikely everywhere but it &apos;s not offensive .
in Germany the situation is next , the State Ministry , no financial media , take the design of law projects , which are often linked to the industry .
this kind of law projects are approved after the B@@ und@@ est@@ ag , the German parliament .
in this way , the entire power isn &apos;t the people , and as he claims in the Western democracies of Western democracies , but the strong financial groups representing their own interests .
it &apos;s obvious that the democracies with a liberal orientation find themselves quickly in a situation how the one described Ap@@ pi@@ á@@ us in the R@@ am of C@@ esar and Pom@@ pe@@ ya , &quot; the state had been dis@@ integrated in time . &quot;
in exchange for bri@@ gain , fav@@ ors and help to finance rocks or sp@@ ades .
the bri@@ be and corruption was extended without any impedi@@ ment , and people would go to the ballot with the vote in advance , so once , because of this organization , the state was going to be really in the process , so once , by the way , this organization was going to be the most serious human being , so ...
the conclusion , the same way in the anti@@ age , it is that the current society is based on dis@@ considered the individual benefits without considering the common interests .
private capital is not able to , in its essence , to understand and claim the benefits of all society .
the result is the same as then , a dec@@ ad@@ ency of the unprecedented elite without an attempt to reform it in depth .
the causes of the fasci@@ sts and commun@@ ists must be looking for , therefore , in the un@@ armed liberalisation of economic systems in the 19@@ th century and 20th .
with respect for the current situation , it &apos;s possible to consider the disappearance of these systems in the benefit of a liberal democracy , like a defined break , waiting for the next tour .
the fact is the fact that the current government is completely ignored the loss of hundreds of thousands in life , social disasters and water that we &apos;ve been witnesses in the ancient history and the most recent .
the suspension of public law enforcement is not the solution ; at least not long @-@ term .
under pressure pressure , so much international level and inside the Union , the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to keep looking for other ways to reduce the social level of population .
this tendency is , therefore , monitor .
the solution goes through reforms specific policies , which support so much for the capital of the state as the influence of the citizens in the government and to weaken the capital of capital in society .
Israel : the lab of chaos .
&quot; that dece@@ ased , you know , I &apos;m not allowed to do anything . &quot;
&quot; if my kids didn &apos;t want wars , there would be no Gu@@ tel@@ er , my wife of Mayer Am@@ sch@@ el Roth@@ s@@ child , in his death in the year 18@@ 49 . &quot;
after the last mis@@ siles of violence between Israel and Gaza &apos;s sni@@ ff , they &apos;ve come up , as always .
one , the side of Israel , be@@ tray@@ al favor of self @-@ defense and pe@@ as@@ ing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists .
I don &apos;t want to focus on who &apos;s guilty of the killing that they re@@ plic@@ ated and who is the victim at last and Corpor@@ al , the citizens of today in Israel , they were born in the current political situation , born in the current political situation .
my intention is to offer the read@@ ers a look behind the cur@@ tain , a look to find out who &apos;s taking advantage of the tensions they dragged from the Bal@@ four of the Middle East .
some of my considerations are based on historical events , others in conclusions to which I &apos;ve come on the base of my own way to understand the point of my own way to understand the matter , about who or the group of people is the main @-@ story .
in the history of humanity the history of fighting is in the first row .
in every day we can find a Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ro Mag@@ no or an Napole@@ on .
but what &apos;s not so obvious is if it was always these charac@@ ters that they ran their way to their own independent way or if behind their thr@@ one had someone who was planning their actions towards a certain objective .
we must accept that we live in a time to focus the world &apos;s wealth in a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that involves , has not been able to get in a single generation .
among these astron@@ ically rich family families , that would be a one who could consider the most prominent .
he doesn &apos;t write much near them .
naturally .
in the 19@@ th century , they bought the first news agency .
they have important involved in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries in which they &apos;re not represented , has been declared or is preparing for a war : before the attack to Afghanistan was seven countries , after the attack of Iraq .
everyone who tried to oppose this family has died .
A@@ bra@@ ham Lincoln refused to renew the bank bank from America from America of America .
J@@ F@@ K began to im@@ pri@@ te money and I wanted to suspend the federal reserve system .
his appeal for world power took them during the 18@@ 71 , 18@@ 71 to bring up a plan with three world wars designed by the oil .
the first war was a target to eliminate the big mon@@ sters in all Europe ; the second wanted to eliminate the country supreme , especially Grand Britain , and the third one was proposed to reduce the population in the middle of a million sl@@ aves .
the method that the group operates the richest families , along with the Roth@@ s@@ child , follow the dynam@@ ity of crisis damage and the subsequent offer of a solution .
these solutions are , however , wrong , and they always get an increase in the situation , if no , that &apos;s not the way that the EDF was created for a crisis like the year 19@@ 07 .
so , after success of the murder of the extermin@@ ator to the Austr@@ ite @-@ Hungarian , Francisco Fern@@ ando , Francisco Fern@@ ando , in Sarajevo and after , by the way , the First World War was mel@@ ted in the first World War .
the First World War is sudden and un@@ justified since the military view and economic , the captain of Germany .
to prepare the subject of World War , they allowed the ban@@ kers and politicians to grow up , so under@@ cover , a situation in the root of the massive war@@ ri@@ ts in Germany , which was created by the op@@ tim@@ ing of the desperate , which was created by the de@@ tim@@ ation of the Russians .
at the end of the 19@@ th century , the Roth@@ s@@ child pushed the foundation of the spiritual movement , a r@@ ama that was aspir@@ ing into a Jewish state , preferably in the former Ju@@ dea &apos;s .
the Bal@@ four claims previously sat the bases for mass immigration to Palestine and started the first conflicts with the Arab population .
terrorist attacks were built in both sides .
he blew up the Second World War , it &apos;s hard to know if Hitler sho@@ ved too much into the rope that they had .
Israel was officially founded in 19@@ 48 and so similar to the way the war repa@@ irs are the way to the Second World War .
if the international ban@@ kers get started , the Jewish nation , as in the Second World War , would become victim at first line of combat , now with the Arab population or , usually , Muslims in the Middle East .
Israel is a huge lab , a single machine machine and chaos , not just in the context of their country , but also international scale .
who &apos;s guilty and who &apos;s the victim in Palestinian @-@ Israeli conflict ?
at this point , we need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their bos@@ ses , because as it happens in our country , the international ban@@ kers only present their candidates in elections .
the current president of Israel , this is the typical example of fasci@@ st politics , loyal to the international ban@@ kers , which makes it all possible to declare the world to Iran , and , considering that Iran is a member of Sh@@ ang@@ hai &apos;s world .
under which light they show now the words that David Roc@@ k@@ ef@@ el@@ el@@ ler had in 1994 : &quot; the only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order . &quot;
the new world order in his imagination is a world of gentlemen and sl@@ aves .
a world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the financial ari@@ st@@ ocr@@ acy .
a world in which every new individual is being introduced to a chip that controls all his being .
&quot; and oblig@@ es everyone , small and big , rich and poor , free and sl@@ aves , have a mark in the right hand or on the front , &quot; not to get the name of this monster or their name . &quot;
it &apos;s necessary to understand , who have two fingers in front of the monster , that I get the numbers of this monster .
the number marks the person and this number is thir@@ teen and six . &quot;
film !
in November of 1979 a group of Islam@@ istic students took the American emb@@ assy in Te@@ an and took 52 diplom@@ ates like hostages .
his release was going to be in return for the dis@@ tr@@ ault Moham@@ ed R@@ é@@ za P@@ é@@ h@@ le@@ vi , which after the revolution escaped the USA , which had spon@@ sor@@ ed his regime for decades .
for the American administration , the situation didn &apos;t offer any positive prospects : throw the sha@@ h out of the way I couldn &apos;t afford it , because , if I did it , the trust of their allies in other countries .
but in freedom of hostages in Iran , where the revolution had resulted in the constitution of the the@@ ocr@@ atic regime , he wasn &apos;t to its reach .
it was a shock to the United States .
the prisoners arrested were released 4@@ 44 days after the government &apos;s negotiating government .
in America , his destiny caused a wave of solidarity and stimul@@ ation against Iran .
the failure in Iran helped to be decisive to Jimmy Carter &apos;s defeat .
the film &quot; Ar@@ go &quot; of the director and an actor Ben Af@@ f@@ read@@ k feared a episode of this story , which tic@@ ked a little success for America .
shortly before you take the emb@@ assy , you escaped six employees from the building .
after a complicated head@@ suit , they ended up in the Canadian emb@@ assy .
CIA , in collaboration with the Canadian authorities , managed to get them out of Iran , for it helped an under@@ cover story .
combination of gang@@ sters
the plan that drew the expert in &quot; ex@@ le@@ ation &quot; T@@ oni Men@@ dez wanted the cooperation of Hollywood .
so that the lie appears to be seen , he wrote about the film project in specialist magaz@@ ines , the production of press officers , the production society was even a real office .
the details of the operation kept in secret for a long time , the film has been made of Tony Men@@ dez &apos;s memories .
the Col@@ f@@ read@@ k film is a combination of several g@@ ents .
by the way , a realistic political thri@@ ller , for another , one called &quot; chap@@ er &quot; , the story of an episode that came out well , a dece@@ ased .
in the film they combine the mood states .
for the other , typical scenes of Hollywood a lot more li@@ ghter , marked by ir@@ ony and a le@@ ague exagger@@ ation .
and besides , the CIA of the CIA and other institutions .
Ben Af@@ f@@ read@@ k has managed to reopen his career in a great way .
the actor , which had been the object of mo@@ las , has become a respec@@ table director and their way to be stopped being the target of ir@@ onic observation .
R@@ ate is his third @-@ end , after &quot; small @-@ bye , good @-@ bye . &quot;
at the same time , it &apos;s the first film film in which the action has no place in Boston City , where he raised .
also , the sens@@ ation of the atmosphere was a feature that had to put the previous film directors above Hollywood standards .
and Af@@ f@@ read@@ k shows up in Ar@@ go , where Te@@ an is .
the best scenes in the film have place in the streets in the reconstruction of the un@@ accounted ent events of the emb@@ assy .
Es@@ f@@ read@@ k and your associ@@ ates get a similar effect on the scenes .
too much action in too many places .
the director had to accept the fact that a story explained not much in the cinema of the most intri@@ otic scenes .
and it &apos;s all right , sometimes you add something to reality .
Ar@@ go &apos;s sk@@ ull is the control that comes from the need to show too much action in too many places .
Alan Ar@@ kin and John Good@@ man have a very funny role as Hollywood workers , even though their charac@@ ters did deserve more space and they &apos;re not much less , the only ones in this film .
for these reasons , the Col@@ f@@ read@@ k film loses a bit of dramatic tr@@ aces , but it &apos;s a film that can continue with a moderate interest , analy@@ ze its execution and the style of a thri@@ ller that ev@@ ents the years 70 .
but that will get down , that &apos;ll be hard .
like ev@@ oc@@ ation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated they can be , they can be the no@@ tions of om@@ ni@@ ity and om@@ nu@@ science , it &apos;s enough .
rules for bal@@ lo@@ ons , bananas and circus circus
the war@@ ehouse w@@ w@@ w@@ .@@ Mont@@ ov@@ ni@@ po@@ m , that every year comes up a survey on the most absurd bank rates , now he has decided to announce the competition on the most absurd regulations , now he has decided to announce the competition on the &quot; regulations &quot; or the most absurd ideas in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; we came up after the last event , the EU has scheduled to adopt a 40 percent fee from women in the main European companies . &quot; explained P@@ acu@@ vo Patri@@ k , the organiz@@ er of the festival .
among the absurd nomin@@ ees is , for example , the recent decision of the European Court of uni@@ fy the insurance be@@ ts between men and women .
until now , women were making better prices in life insurance because they represent a minor risk .

the choice will have a place at the end of February 19@@ th , reported N@@ yce .
between the controversial regulations in the EU , for example , the mandatory addition of bio@@ components to fuel that , as a result , damage the environment , another ban is the use of mercury in the entire life of life .
he has critici@@ zed the use of using the expression &quot; un@@ accounted for , &quot; or the re@@ treat of the classi@@ cal bul@@ ly .
a quality banana must have a 14 @-@ inch length .
the Union &apos;s device takes this kind of decisions often under the pressure of one or other war@@ ehouse or industrial pressure , whose requests in Brussels are defending the demands of their banks .
the interests of a lobby were behind the request , for example , that the highest @-@ quality bananas had to have in the European Union for a long time at least 14 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters and they couldn &apos;t be introduced &quot; Ab@@ mal creatures . &quot;
the European Commission was defending saying that with this just looking for the national standards not to harmon@@ ized national standards to the date , just complic@@ ated their marketing .
the rules that are made to fruit and vegetables in the European Union , despite the opposition of some states , they &apos;ve been wiped up on the base that the existing directive has a waste of comfort .
the candidate to win the desk could be the European Union &apos;s prescription last year according to which in the inf@@ or@@ y bal@@ lo@@ ons that are trad@@ ed by the inf@@ ating of an adult .
the Union made reference here to a American study of which , when he talks about toys , the bal@@ lo@@ ons are the main cause of child death .
it &apos;s also a similar restriction to the use of killing you by the way of children to 14 years .
funny events are born even in our country
equally absurd is the regulations regarding European officials , all that have an official function in the European Union can &apos;t use Macedonia &apos;s name , you must be talking about Jer@@ de .
the B@@ ank@@ ov@@ si@@ po@@ bi@@ si@@ si@@ t@@ plat@@ k@@ y@@ m , in collaboration with the Democratic econom@@ ists .
the European Union has determined the maximum food supplies that can be found in the Republic of the Czech Republic the same day of our entrance to the Union .
after , the Czech Republic over@@ passed , for example , the line established to se@@ ts , which gives him a substantial threat threat .
the organiz@@ ers are also interested in paying them to pay for those countries that don &apos;t have access to the sea and the idea of putting a grant for subsidies .
this kind of ideas didn &apos;t burn in Brussels but in Prague .
&quot; we &apos;re at a disadvantage for not having sea . &quot;
we asked the European Union a compensation , declared in the autumn of the 2004 Po@@ os@@ lav Pal@@ as .
he was arguing with the fact that in our country I had a lot of cereal and , as a consequence of the intervention calls , the state had the war@@ dro@@ be .
according to Pal@@ as , since the Czech Republic is far from sea ports , the EU should pay for hundreds of millions of euros .
at the end , the European Commission showed up to help the Czech Republic and set a public contest for the purchase of the countries who have no access to the sea .
the grant to receive a grant was proposed to the local council for local development directed by the Minister P@@ av@@ el N@@ icky .
the rare prescri@@ ptions are an exception .
the guidelines of the members are often white , the efforts of the European regulations and , plus , a functioning and more effective development in the Union deserve more well , according to several experts , our recognition .
according to the experts , the most serious problem is , for example , the EU &apos;s allowance for projects that you have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration , but the members of the members have managed to meet the negotiations on the budgets .
the Cz@@ sters are also in the line , so the same way as other countries in the Union , the fight for the source of origin of their traditional products , even though our country has never been vic@@ tori@@ ous .
the Cz@@ sters , after six years of fighting with Germans and Austrian , they defended the stat@@ ue of origin of Ol@@ om@@ ou@@ c , but they had to change the name to the national rum , which was called the 19@@ th century , and he had to call the name to the national rum .
only products prepared from the sugar bas@@ ket , they can be called rum , but not those facts to get out of sugar .
in the official official stat@@ ue of origin of the United States of origin , along with the ugly bel@@ ls and spar@@ ky hat in all the world , the German C@@ ü@@ bec@@ k &apos;s ma@@ ker , and the ham of Par@@ m , the Po@@ ho@@ sha@@ eli@@ an &apos;s car@@ t , and the ham of Par@@ m ,
as a victim of the European Union , they can be proud of Par@@ du@@ b@@ ice &apos;s bread and Ho@@ hr@@ ice v Po@@ d@@ k@@ r@@ k@@ uc@@ k@@ k@@ uc@@ k@@ k@@ uc@@ k@@ k@@ k@@ š@@ k@@ y@@ š@@ k@@ š@@ k@@ š@@ i .
people want me to save the public , but I &apos;m an amat@@ eur , claims O@@ k@@ am@@ ura .
Mr. Honor , how did you get into the election for president ?
it &apos;s not about being a sen@@ ator or president .
if in our country all right , then I wouldn &apos;t introduce my candid@@ acy .
but I can &apos;t stand to see how you steal in the last twenty years in our country , how the thi@@ eves are going down , the taxes and age of retirement .
I had no ambition to be political .
when I see something I &apos;m not like , I &apos;m trying to give it a solution to change it .
and since I &apos;ve already got 40 and my candid@@ acy is independent , the only possibility I have to change things is like a sen@@ ator or president .
the Senate has arrived , but shortly after the presidency .
he &apos;s not giving the back to those people who have voted ?
I always said my candid@@ acy to the presidency would depend on the results in the sen@@ ator &apos;s election .
later I know that if I jumped a sen@@ ator , I &apos;d introduce my candid@@ acy to the presidency .
but my goal isn &apos;t the function ; the function is the tool that I can actually do my own ideas .
that &apos;s why I need the greatest influence and the stronger as possible .
the problem isn &apos;t just that we &apos;re a nation that we critici@@ zed in the bar or in front of TV , but we &apos;ve covered anyone who wants to start a change .
this is what the media means , that you dis@@ appoint and confused freedom of expression with freedom of lie .
I &apos;m told that I &apos;ve bri@@ bed journalists or I &apos;ve been murderer of Ji@@ hr@@ be@@ k Par@@ ou@@ be@@ k .
let &apos;s talk about your ideas .
he &apos;s up to presidential struggle with a financial @-@ based material and criminal responsibility and the statement of property above 20 million .
it must change the law .
as president doesn &apos;t have this competition and only the sen@@ e in his own can propose laws .
how do you want to figure it out ?
as a citizen , I &apos;ve formed part of a pressure group that the lead of guidance would recognize as an independent job , and we did it .
the problem is in politics , if somebody comes with a good proposal , whether it &apos;s right or left , it &apos;s rejected by purpose and this affects the citizens .
as an independent candidate , I &apos;ve got a bigger potential to get the support of all parliamentary groups .
without a le@@ ather , no sign , I have the ability to choose something that is better for our country and apply it .
do you think a man of a right or a left ?
from the Czech view , I have the impression that people consider me more left .
for me you &apos;re not important , be a little left or a little right .
what I care about is we go ahead .
I don &apos;t care if somebody &apos;s right or left , I want to join people .
I always support any good solution , regardless of whether the proposal comes from K@@ S@@ LE@@ M or the O@@ DS and the same way , I &apos;ll be against the bad ideas .
you &apos;re kidding me when you say it &apos;s popu@@ list .
but he &apos;s not showing him what he says ?
when he creates a business plan for the company , you have some goals and ideals .
and you &apos;re trying to get closer to them .
there will be anyone named popu@@ lism , but all the proposals that I &apos;m talking about .
but without the support of the parliament , you just left you .
and it can &apos;t survive in the long term .
or do you think that if you &apos;re headed to people and talk to them , you get , for example , a criminal and financial responsibility ?
I have no choice .
convince politicians , journalists and civil society and try to get them out of my share .
if he were elected president , he would have no problem in organiz@@ ing a direct re@@ transmission in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to blame for the criminal and legal responsibility for politicians .
and eventually they would have to communicate why they don &apos;t want it .
if there &apos;s a strong character that shows up the disputes , you can make pressure on the political scene .
let &apos;s take the direct choice of president , which has been a public pressure achievement .
at the same time I swear I &apos;m just a fan , I &apos;m not a genius or an intellectual .
for my opinions and ideals trying to get allies .
I just started politics and try to get the greatest support for my program .
I &apos;m trying to get things out of myself , but in case I don &apos;t get out , in six years I will leave it and I &apos;ll get back to private sector .
sounds like a bit like O@@ k@@ am@@ ura to save the Czech Republic .
I &apos;m not saved .
I know that with a person I do nothing , that &apos;s why I &apos;ve visited a series of known person@@ alities , by case the best they were encouraged to present their candid@@ ory .
I went to see Rad@@ im Jan@@ č@@ ura , but he refused because he had a lot of work .
for my part , at least I &apos;ve supported the J@@ ana Lor@@ en@@ co@@ v@@ va for J@@ ana Lor@@ en@@ co@@ v@@ ah , who took the light into the light with olive oil .
I introduced myself from the base that people are really satisfied , now I &apos;m in the balance .
sixty percent of the population didn &apos;t come to the guards and , those who did it , voted for the representatives of the establishment .
in the sen@@ ado we &apos;re two of the independent sector .
people chose the sen@@ e , so it &apos;ll be complicated to change changes .
however , I will defend my own ideas , like the direct choice of mayor or rul@@ ers .
is she considering his own party ?
I haven &apos;t even considered it because I have no time for it , to check out the light of each of the potential members of the game , or I have no money .
I have no money or the campaign to the presidency , in my transparent account only there &apos;s 20,000 .
don &apos;t you have any money ?
talk about property statements , how is it ?
I think my private property in 60 million .
in Prague , I &apos;ve got a matter of 25 million , a flat worth 10 million , another floor .
by the way , I have an A@@ ston Martin because I was my dream of youth .
do a A@@ ston Martin , his property is in 60 million and he has no money for the campaign ?
you said he wants to change the public , but he doesn &apos;t want to get too much money .
it &apos;s not very convincing .
I don &apos;t have 15 million for the campaign .
have I got debt ?
in the campaign I &apos;ve put $ 200 million .
the fact that I don &apos;t have any spon@@ sor shows that there &apos;s no interest in my program .
and I have no obligation to pay the campaign with my pocket .
the campaign expenses cover in essence what I &apos;ll receive in a sen@@ ator &apos;s salary .
but I couldn &apos;t live from it , for example , I couldn &apos;t pay for my son the English school , which costs 30@@ ,000 monthly .
if I wanted to just make money , then I wouldn &apos;t introduce myself as a candidate .
so he &apos;ll keep your business activity to live ?
didn &apos;t he say before he was gonna leave this activity ?
this has nothing to do with a major salary .
like I promised , partly I left my activities .
for example , the manager of my travel agency will be my replacement in spring .
people want me to be the s@@ amar@@ it@@ ano to save the public .
but I need to live in something .
how much used to winning men@@ su@@ ally as a business@@ man ?
between 200@@ ,000 and 4@@ 00,000 , I keep winning .
if he were president , then I &apos;d leave business .
he can consult all the interview in P@@ acu@@ va &apos;s Day .
the studio of M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ D@@ V shows that the real advent@@ ures are not only in the head of Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ is@@ se and the newly finished ...
&quot; I think the building is fun , you have a look @-@ up , and finally there &apos;s something interesting to see &quot; , &quot; claims Li@@ set@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ ig , a tran@@ se@@ te .
and Stef@@ an S@@ per@@ mon , T@@ I &apos;s tech@@ nici@@ mon .
but I wonder why we need a library today .
we all have the Internet , tab@@ lets and electronic books .
nobody come in taste in these past fashion libraries , right ?
Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ is@@ se , a town asleep to R@@ ó@@ Florida &apos;s gates that barely deserve a fu@@ g@@ az visi@@ tor , holding the doub@@ ous honor to forget .
the population of 8@@ 0,000 people presents the lower al@@ sol@@ e@@ zation rate in the Netherlands .
to counter@@ end this situation so desperate , a few years ago he decided to contribute to the general culture and copy the seven bridges that appear to be represented in the euro @-@ shaped bills .
the success of educational offensive was limited .
and that &apos;s how responsible politicians decided that only a possibility to improve the statistics ... had to build a library !
Win@@ y Ma@@ as , the story of Dutch M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ D@@ D@@ D@@ D@@ V , a whole teacher in the art of bars and so responsible for fun buildings , took the subject with their usual cour@@ thou@@ se , and he took over to the presentation of the competition in the next year .
and as long as the jury looked at you and I &apos;d get caught up , Ma@@ as ran the books by size of the size of a pi@@ rami@@ tive and concluded his brief speech with the next words :
here you are , my proposal for the mountains of Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ is@@ se .
nine years later , the 30 million dollars rise in the scheduled place .
this form part of the revit@@ alization project , which is complete with a sub@@ way parking lot , a super@@ market , an office of post and a couple of houses of housing and wor@@ ship .
at first , the mountain of books was gal@@ ar@@ don@@ ated with the second prize .
besides , the project is also nomin@@ ated to &quot; Dutch W@@ ood A@@ ward 2012 . &quot;
this way , the little city of history , that until the date I had nothing more than to offer a multi @-@ modern pe@@ destri@@ an area and an incredibly ugly war@@ ehouse after whose white fac@@ ade one would say so much .
but especially , Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ is@@ se has now the first public cultural building in their history .
the long way to the book
the first impression is this about a book paradi@@ se .
well , it &apos;s true that there &apos;s an elev@@ ator that transport us right to the center of this m@@ aci@@ ous mountain , but the real lo@@ vers of space and reading will not use it , but they prefer to mess with their to@@ po@@ graphy every step .
inside the inside , the entire ri@@ gh@@ te@@ y turns out and easy to cover up with the view , the lad@@ de of the lad@@ de , and the pe@@ as@@ ons support the public condition of the library .
the urban atmosphere is perfect .
the eye can reach the park .
and everywhere , books and books .
&quot; normally the books of books are prepared along the front and in the center open a huge dark @-@ bloo@@ ded dark , usually being something awkward and im@@ personal , &quot; claims Win@@ y Ma@@ as .
what we &apos;ve done is to put it up to the classi@@ cal range and get the under@@ cover area in the outside .
the inside of the mountain is very well exploited in the middle of you find the offices , the Internet library , the ch@@ ess club , the center of environmental education and the maintenance room .
special mention .
the view , the t@@ act and smell are weird .
even the architec@@ ts and civilian engine@@ ers more than day to get your head out when they hear about this unknown stuff .
&quot; we wanted to work with recycl@@ ed materials , &quot; explain Jo@@ op T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st , chief of the project in Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ is@@ se .
and that &apos;s how a day , in a war@@ ehouse farm , we ran out with the right sub@@ product from agriculture .
since many years , in the last few years , in the past , in the past , in the past , in the past , in the middle of the Netherlands , you use a plastic tissue of little me@@ ters as a base to hold the keys of the crops .
it &apos;s about cheap and efficient material .
this fin@@ al tissue .
for the library this tissue has given , for the first time in such amounts , even if I get four @-@ inch me@@ ters .
with the heat and pressure , the great agricultural plastic .
after 105 la@@ damage , he gets the top of the mountain .
at the end of this road , you &apos;re almost 500 me@@ ters around the mountain .
these create a nice environment to the couple of you keep the proper atmo@@ ity for this mountain mountain .
donations for a new soul
&quot; even though I believe you believe in your big ac@@ ri@@ tism , this building is an exemplary project in what matters to the ec@@ ology , &quot; points T@@ rou@@ bor@@ st .
the heat and the necessary refriger@@ ation get off of ge@@ ot@@ ic energy .
even though the mountain of books is under a huge glass of crystal , even more lon@@ el@@ ed in the sun only in the dark .
the huge grav@@ ey@@ eb@@ ings in regard to trans@@ ver@@ salt the glass of glass serve to give a shadow and absorb most of the sun .
this creates a comfortable weather .
the rest is the automatic thing .
Stef@@ an S@@ per@@ mon , the sk@@ ep@@ tic of the intelligence of the intelligence , he has already dar@@ ed to put foot on the new library .
and Li@@ set@@ te Ver@@ ha@@ ig has also been there .
also , the Chinese medical teacher Cy@@ n@@ thia Bo@@ gar@@ thia has visited the library .
the reason is , with reason the opening that had a couple of weeks ago , he invited all the inhabitants of the city to don@@ ate a book from their private collection .
this way to fill up , at the moment , the op@@ tic flies of a library who still doesn &apos;t count with their entire file ; currently he has 7@@ 0,000 gu@@ ts .
the concept has warm .
the st@@ akes are .
&quot; there &apos;s nothing worse than an empty library , &quot; claims the architec@@ t Win@@ y Ma@@ as .

they all know that their book is part of the library .
even though he &apos;s only there to love .
in this way , the M@@ V@@ R@@ D@@ D@@ V study has achieved all this success in that queen queen that in the ar@@ got of an identity .
the city of Spi@@ j@@ k@@ en@@ is@@ se has written a piece of liter@@ ature of liter@@ ature .
regardless of young and un@@ selfish that I can be .
finally a point to con@@ form your identity .
Sz@@ ab@@ o :
Germany has forgotten in the vote about Palestine &apos;s admission .
according to Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o , expert in America .
Pet@@ sche W@@ elle :
however , finally Berlin was held up .
why ?
Stephen Sz@@ ab@@ o :
now , because of the special relationship that joined the country with Israel , Germany must be careful .
but at the same time I think you don &apos;t support the American position .
Germany wanted to prove his independence without being too critical with Israel .
during the upri@@ sing he had place in Libya in March 2011 , Germany also ab@@ held when what was meant to establish a flight ban .
this has been declared finally for NATO .
does it seem hard to Germany to adopt a clear position when they &apos;re in international affairs ?
Yeah , that &apos;s it .
this must be that in these moments he &apos;s re@@ orient@@ ating his foreign policy , away from a policy leading , so to speak , for the United States and focus on a German foreign policy .
and what makes it worse is that the Europeans don &apos;t have a coherent and uniform .
so the Germans find themselves in a p@@ enci@@ le .
they expect you to play a more independent role , but they &apos;re not used to it .
I think they &apos;re still looking who &apos;s his role , but they &apos;ve already started the way to a foreign policy . &quot;
a similar foreign policy to the countries like France or Britain .
what does this mean specifically a foreign policy from the German perspective ?
it &apos;s a policy that , when it comes to national interests , it shows up to defend different positions to America or their European partners .
I think the German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy , I mean , in exports and in relations with certain regions , as they can be Russia , China or the Middle East .
German economic interests are true to certain different powers and for that reason Germany must protect their interests .
are you economic interests in the position adopted in the Middle East and the UN voting ?
by side , Germany counts with big markets in the Middle East , especially the Gulf .
for this reason you must be careful and un@@ alien about the Arab opinion or not the Arab leaders .
this is important , of course .
but I wouldn &apos;t give you so much importance since it &apos;s not a totally unilateral relationship .
however , you do a fundamental role in German considerations .
did you undermine Germany your relationship with America ?
I think in Europe , and even in America , the German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding .
for this reason , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a dramatic break@@ up as in Libya &apos;s case .
maybe with it Germany has accomplished a certain respect .
at last , all this has done not to prove that it &apos;s a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests have to be considered .
in Europe they exist different opinions about Palestinian initiative .
instead , America has clearly shown up for a veto .
did you fire opinions between America ?
there &apos;s always been these disparities due to American politics .
I think Obama &apos;s government shows in secret a great understanding towards the European position .
but because of the political situation that lives here , it &apos;s obvious that the government can &apos;t defend in public that position .
I think the real shot of opinions has no reality in reality .
if we analy@@ ze relations between Obama and Prime Minister Net@@ any@@ ahu , we see that Obama &apos;s not at all excited with politics .
does it seem hard to Germany to reconcile the close relationships that keeping Israel and America , by the way , with their main partners in the European Union , for another ?
I think that &apos;s exactly what makes it so hard for the Germans .
of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if I existed a coherent and uniform European policy , but it &apos;s not the case .
therefore , they don &apos;t have the possibility of being part of a top , but they must push things from their own position .
that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;re doing now with the euro .
I think in future Germany will take a role role at the time to force Europe to adopt a European position .
of course this isn &apos;t easy for Germany , be just because of the relationship keeping Israel .
this has always been a question .
but I think the Germans are clear that you should have the independent figure of figure .
do you see Germany to itself in the important international actor ?
or perhaps he &apos;s still hard to accept that leadership ?
Germany hasn &apos;t been used yet , always turns out something awkward and , for obvious reasons , the country keeps spending a more important role .
if we observe the euro crisis , for example , we see that every time Germany ple@@ ases like a chief actor , they get rid of the anti @-@ German feelings .
this isn &apos;t easy for the Germans .
it &apos;s about an old problem and it &apos;s that nobody wants to be surrounded by the enemies .
seen this way , Germany is in a lot more difficult than America .
you must show a recep@@ tive attitude in front of the different neighb@@ ors and opinions and that doesn &apos;t happen easy .
America &apos;s influence .
the Germans won &apos;t be more remedy than to assume a more powerful role .
even if you don &apos;t like it , if you get upset or if you become a town even more popular , c &apos;@@ est la vie !

&quot; protection protection &quot; in China when Pu@@ ma and Ar@@ man@@ i become Chinese marks
Ar@@ man@@ i &apos;s a known mark to global level and Polo Lauren , too .
but what &apos;s Ar@@ man@@ i Polo ?
after this name you &apos;re hiding a officially registered print in China but you have nothing to do with the original companies .
however , this protection enjoys while the real ones we didn &apos;t get a suit .
and even then it &apos;s not clear that you &apos;re gonna give the reason .
&quot; to the foreigners becomes more difficult to protect their mark@@ ings in China , &quot; points Thomas P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch , lawyer from the firm Taylor W@@ essing speci@@ alized in traffic violations .
every week comes to my table a new case .
the nurses simply add a couple of letters to search their mark@@ ings .
this way , Guc@@ ci becomes L@@ u @-@ Guc@@ ci and instead of Pr@@ ada @-@ K@@ ny .
German companies are also legally linked to the same way , as it has happened to the medical of sports .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch opens a file in which he keeps a seat seats from the Beijing &apos;s .
September 14@@ th 2010 a Chinese company called to search the Z@@ eg@@ na silver mark .
that the Chinese are world champi@@ ons in that copy and violating intellectual property rights is known as known .
in big cities there are great war@@ ships of several dedicated plants exclusively to the falsi@@ fying sale .
however , P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch &apos;s cases are otherwise .
the Chinese call him &quot; B@@ ang M@@ ing P@@ ai P@@ ai &quot; or he &apos;s picking up .
the word has its origin in the Chinese term &quot; B@@ ang D@@ ak@@ u@@ an , &quot;
that makes women a rich fish .
Chinese authorities don &apos;t feel guilty
&quot; it &apos;s harmful to business , we need to fight it , &quot; requires P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch .
&quot; the mark makes water , the plat@@ pol@@ tical position dis@@ appears and the damage that suffers the image is huge . &quot;
the financial and environmental losses of the affected sectors are milli@@ on@@ aire , especially in the cre@@ epy product of luxury .
according to the C@@ L@@ SA market analysis , with a volume of 15@@ ,000 million euros a year China is , in size , the third market of luxury and which grows greater rhy@@ th@@ m .
however , however , we get the objec@@ encies of doubtful legality in the mark of the mark turns out complicated and also a lot of money .
the processes can be extended till nine years and the result is uncertain .
P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch talks about cases that the cour@@ thou@@ se didn &apos;t think of a law@@ suit because he had so much time the name of the law@@ suit had become a reality of market .
&quot; if the defend@@ ant has bad luck , maybe even if I have to pay money to the lo@@ ather because the process has damaged the mark of this in China &quot;
sometimes this is the law of the jungle .
some of the most unknown cases have to do with char@@ ts .
in 2009 D@@ aim@@ ler @-@ Ben@@ z lost a ple@@ ad against the C@@ any R@@ au@@ me@@ ist@@ er .
that &apos;s why today the Chinese can continue using a very similar fan to Merc@@ edes .
the Vol@@ vo , Ge@@ ely , used to use a target in white and blue , that remembered in great measure to B@@ M@@ W .
the L@@ aco@@ e is lost in China .
the Chinese authorities are not guilty .
C@@ T@@ M@@ O &apos;s office office in Beijing recogni@@ zes that in 2010 they had difficulty due to the shortage of equipment and staff .
last year , however , &quot; the labour emergency situation returned to normal . &quot;
in this way , the amount of complaint procedures un@@ solved has been reduced in a hundred % .
almost 5@@ 7@@ ,000 of these cases were solved , a 75 % more than last year .
however 8@@ 1.@@ 500 complaints are still pending .
fighting this .
like being usual in China , the figures are surprising .
last year the C@@ T@@ M@@ O recorded more than $ 1,@@ 4 million requests , almost a third more than 2010 .
it would be a new record and it means China leading by tenth year the list of new form@@ encies in all the world , according to the show of marks .
looks like this is also happening with the number of valid logi@@ sts , number that amounts to 5@@ .5 billion in total .
in 2011 , they would have taken up 1.@@ 800 million of yu@@ ans in the concept of rights .
said another way , this means a half @-@ every @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 .
fighting this cost a lot of money , and as it proves the German government &apos;s business case .
since seven years the group fight in the courts against a Chinese impres@@ ner .
well , if the Germans have managed to stop the illegal vehicle of the car pieces ,
the impres@@ ner has managed to secure Chinese rights about the Fre@@ ud@@ enberg brand .
&quot; we &apos;ve caused this situation because in Germany , the words are not protected , &quot; says Han@@ no W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler , president and Con@@ sel@@ enberg Ch@@ em@@ ore Ch@@ em@@ ore . &quot;
C@@ T@@ M@@ O &apos;s office is also dis@@ estimate the supply of the am@@ qu@@ tics .
in the next two bodies they gave the point to Fre@@ ud@@ enberg , but the opposite is still fighting at the moment .
we have to be careful .
now the case has come to the Court of Justice Su@@ peri@@ or , where he continues .
W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler trust@@ s the way you can solve the matter and the profession@@ ality of the courts .
however , he also claims that &quot; procedure is extremely expensive , in terms of money and time . &quot;
turns out how hard the internal costs are , the business file has had to check up files for a hundred years in order to provide evidence .
five years ago , Fre@@ ud@@ enberg offered the opposite of six figures in euros with the target of getting a friendly agreement , but he didn &apos;t succeed .
&quot; this proves how much we care about , &quot; says W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
the dangers that enter in Ex@@ tre@@ mo America threaten even affect Europe ,
specifically if the impres@@ ners make sure there are no protected rights .
so a Chinese manufacturer tried to search in Germany the Fre@@ ud@@ enberg name for shoes and skin products .
long time the group abandoned this commercial field , however he managed to stop the registration .
&quot; have to be very careful , &quot; claims W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
so he &apos;s as well as the lawyer P@@ att@@ lo@@ ch recommend the German companies to be extremely cautious at the time of making business with China .
it &apos;s not enough to trust international law enforcement , but what is to be done is &quot; search also in China all that can be sensitive , and as W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler . &quot;
otherwise , the subject may be a lot more expensive than a simple record .
in fact , in case Fre@@ ud@@ enberg lost the last assault of his particular battle , then I would have to pay the opposite of license for his own name , and as it explains W@@ ent@@ z@@ ler .
that or in the seg@@ ment will be expelled from the market .

help for self help
according to an I@@ DA I@@ DA estimate , the United Nations Day to combat AIDS , in all the world exists approximately 34 million infected people by the HIV virus .
23 million of them live in South Africa .
in Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia there &apos;s 2@@ 4@@ 5,000 orph@@ ans of AIDS .
more than 40 % of the population is positive .
the Vo@@ ice Association for Africa has found them in Germany ...
sixty of them at school .
for 15 or 20 bucks a month , you can turn a kid .
this contribution will cover the school tu@@ ition , the uniform and will guarantee a hot food day at Go@@ go C@@ enter .
mo@@ on@@ gi means in l@@ ul@@ u , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; pan@@ aph@@ ist . &quot;
in this room nobody knows .
since the past ten years this lam@@ ll shows songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes you can get them into their place of origin : South Africa .
8@@ 3@@ 33 miles away from He@@ ide@@ l@@ berg from He@@ ide@@ l@@ berg , there is a town called E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni that depends on the voices of this German cor@@ ile cut .
forty percent is infected .
approximately 2,000 people live in there , some are still simple cho@@ king and pa@@ ste , a big part of them are kids .
more than 300 , they don &apos;t have parents because they &apos;ve gone to AIDS .
E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni is a little example of what affects Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia , the higher infection of AIDS and the most low @-@ and @-@ lower , and most low @-@ life .
the population doesn &apos;t go with good eyes the circum@@ ci@@ sion , a practice that according to the risk of infec@@ tion .
more than 40 % of Su@@ az@@ il@@ an@@ dia &apos;s inhabitants are the drug dealers , and die with something more than thirty years has become something unusual .
during a joint trip to Africa in 2005 in 2005 , the cor@@ ner found out this report@@ er , but what they saw about most children in the streets that they had not only the protection of their parents , but the main thing .
without school , the possibilities in a poor country are more than short .
in a beginning , it was just the particular commitment of a few things that could possibly make a child out of school and enjoy a hot food day .
however , a year later the cor@@ ner has reached the association &quot; Vo@@ ice for Africa &quot; that since then he has been profession@@ ally professional from AIDS in E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni .
facts about sexual transmission infec@@ tions
what are the main sexual transmission diseases ?
between the F@@ TS of bac@@ teria , they &apos;re the psy@@ ch@@ lis , the c@@ lam@@ dia and the beach .
the most usual source of origin is AIDS , the human potato virus , the her@@ m@@ oma or the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis .
the thi@@ bles and sar@@ na find each other the E@@ .D. trans@@ par@@ ted by par@@ asi@@ tes .
what are the main groups of affected ?
the sy@@ phi@@ lis and the beach are more frequency in men who keep sex with other men .
the Robert K@@ och part of the base that at least four of every five cases of sy@@ phi@@ lis in Germany has its origin in a sexual contact between men .
in the classi@@ cal adults , the most usual sexual transmission diseases are the infec@@ tions by c@@ lam@@ dia , tric@@ ki@@ ons , the human potato virus , the tu@@ di@@ di@@ asis .
the infection of HIV between the straight adults in the country is relatively scarce , however , approximately 20 % of the new infec@@ tions by HIV .
among young people , the infec@@ tions are much more usual than in other population groups .
according to European polls , three rooms of all infec@@ tions affect young people between 15 and 25 years .
in our country , the human potato virus is also added to more ordinary diseases between youth .
how did the number of infec@@ tions evolve ?
not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to mandatory statement .
according to the Robert K@@ och Institute , the number of infec@@ tions has doubled their number of 1.@@ 6@@ 97 cases in 2001 to 3.@@ 6@@ 98 cases in 2011 .
the number of infec@@ tions by HIV maintains a off@@ ending tendency from 2007 .
in 2011 , there was approximately 2.@@ 700 cases .
it &apos;s about a tenth part less than last year .
what sam@@ ples indicate that this is a cardi@@ ac disease ?
infec@@ tious diseases can cause an ul@@ cer in the conservative zone , inconveni@@ ence to pr@@ ayer , flow , ab@@ domin@@ al pain , so how do you love them ?
you often don &apos;t cause pain or any other symptoms and that &apos;s why I don &apos;t know .
how can one protect ?
the conserv@@ atives can reduce the risk of infec@@ tion , but they don &apos;t provide for a hundred % .
some piece of sexual transmission of sexual transmission diseases can also trans@@ mitt@@ ed through under@@ age infec@@ tions and physical contact .
for this reason , the experts recommend to go regularly into medical tests , especially if they change the sex frequency .
if they diagno@@ sed early , most of the E@@ .D. can cure and it &apos;s possible to help any consequence .
through collabor@@ ations , donations and , last but not at least important , of the honourable men who take the cor@@ e for their actions in all Germany , they get to raise some money .
&quot; long we &apos;ve sent up about $ 200@@ ,000 to E@@ si@@ t@@ j@@ eni , &quot; points proud An@@ nette Len@@ nar@@ tz , president of the association .
in the village , Z@@ od@@ wa D@@ lam@@ ini D@@ lam@@ ini is a safe woman of himself and leadership with management management from Germany .

besides , &quot; Vo@@ ice of Africa &quot; has put up a high school school , built two chick@@ ens and , in collaboration with American P@@ S@@ I , has managed to make a lot of people in the village .
this isn &apos;t obvious , since , despite the patent that he is in all the country , he &apos;s not talking openly about her .
a king with 14 wives .

NA@@ SA , the American space agency has provided evidence of ice existence in Mer@@ heal@@ io .
despite the near@@ est planet to the sun , there is also cold water , and as you get out of three studies published on Thursday at the speci@@ alized magazine . &quot;
the sound Gi@@ eng@@ er would have found evidence that in the planet of the planet you find permanently the shadow of ice .
looks like this has at least 30 c@@ enti@@ me@@ ters and probably even 20 me@@ ters of s@@ weigh .
the water comes from com@@ ets or , with great likelihood , of aster@@ o@@ ids that in their day they hit Mer@@ heal@@ io .
no one link the ice find with the possibility that there is life in the planet , claims the chief investig@@ ator of the Gi@@ eng@@ er , Sean Sol@@ om@@ on .

the mini@@ bus is moving with great str@@ ings through the gu@@ m road that goes on the way to the hi@@ lls side , rivers of great cap@@ e and the simple homes in local farmers .
it &apos;s all green and ju@@ go@@ so , one could even think it &apos;s in Sel@@ va N@@ egr@@ a .
however , we found us in the southern area in Azerbaijan , from here the border with Iran is so lonely .
here they live .
our ultimate destiny is L@@ erec@@ k .
this little city testi@@ fied from a architecture maybe too m@@ aci@@ zed in the Soviet era and that he doesn &apos;t seem to fit in the entire mountain in such a terri@@ fic mountain .
European tourists barely come to this place , since the road from the capital of Azerbaijan , Bak@@ u , turns out too heavy .
to go to the 3@@ 23 kilome@@ ters that separate both urban places , they need eight hours because the road is a single way .
the amazing wealth of which he enjoys .
however , Pil@@ ata Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
&quot; Bak@@ u became famous in May with reason for the World War Day and next year we will celebrate the F@@ our of the most old people in the world &quot;
it &apos;s about the Mu@@ se@@ ev@@ ity Director , maybe the only one exists in the world .
here &apos;s the life of eight dozens of tal@@ y@@ sh@@ is of the place they &apos;ve survived the 100 years of age .
this is my grandfather , who lived 120 years .
a son of yours died at 13@@ 6 years .
however , the un@@ sub of the muse@@ um is the Haw@@ ir@@ ali sheep sh@@ ep@@ ler Pet@@ sl@@ ü@@ mo@@ v , that seems to have lived 16@@ 8 years .
however , there &apos;s no birth game that will be replaced .
and if we &apos;re considering that the old man &apos;s old @-@ documented old @-@ fashioned men lived Alex@@ nu@@ ü@@ mo@@ v &apos;s age is quite suspicious .
&quot; born in the region in 18@@ 05 and died in 1973 &quot; , we explain Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva .
the man was married in three times and he had 23 children .
did you have a mistake then , and then , you know , you &apos;re wrong with your age in a couple of decades ?
however , R@@ embr@@ and@@ t Sch@@ ol@@ z , manager in the Max Pl@@ anc@@ k Institute of Ro@@ stock , he also heard about the advanced age of this area of Central Asia .
&quot; in some of China &apos;s regions , Japan or in Hun@@ za &apos;s val@@ ge in Pakistan also lives very advanced people , &quot; he claims Sch@@ ol@@ z , &quot; even a lot of old men . &quot;
because of lack of documents , it turns out impossible to test scientific evidence about age , especially and when there is no civilian records .
every single day full of dro@@ ps .
it &apos;s a fact that , surpri@@ sing@@ ly frequent , the inhabitants of the region surrounding L@@ erec@@ k usually reach a bi@@ blic@@ al age .
currently there are 20 people who survived 100 years of age .
why are they living here in the South , so many elderly people ?
the F@@ ari@@ d F@@ ari@@ d C@@ ari@@ z@@ ad@@ eh .
the director of the muse@@ um , Mrs. Fat@@ ul@@ ay@@ eva , believes in exchange for the cause of it .
however , from a nutri@@ tional view , it doesn &apos;t seem logical that the rich food in cal@@ ories of the tal@@ y@@ shi , which wor@@ ship meat , bread and mostly dairy products and many of which , plus , usually drink a glass of waste , being so healthy .
or perhaps the form of natural life that keeps young people in C@@ eng@@ em@@ ir@@ an in C@@ eng@@ em@@ ir@@ an , a little mess not far from L@@ erec@@ k &apos;s city .
your 97 years is relatively young for what you &apos;re worth .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva , that claims to have 14@@ 3 descend@@ ents , live in a simple woo@@ den house in the entire Caucasus .
sitting on the ground , moving in shape a huge dro@@ be .
eight people live under a roof , between them and one of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s sons and a daughter of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
you also get some other little kids .
in the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests , tea that they serve in a few typical rooms .
look , Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva &apos;s teeth are white and they &apos;re perfectly alig@@ ned and under the scar@@ f and under the scar@@ f hidden two dark hair tr@@ aces that their son dis@@ covers us proud .
I &apos;ve always wash my hair with milk , so I &apos;ve never fallen and kept your color .
&quot; either I &apos;ve never used a sham@@ po@@ o , &quot; claims Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva .
the pension is enough to live
he &apos;s always eaten only what he built in his own farm : tom@@ atoes , potatoes and gu@@ ts .
in my life I &apos;ve never come to make the purchase a super@@ market .
then he talks about his husband , he was in the army .
the worst was the time behind World War II .
however , everything came back to their ca@@ kes when the dear dad , He@@ y@@ dar Ali@@ y@@ e@@ w , took control of the situation .
this kind of propaganda sounds weird in a woman &apos;s mouth .
however , in Azerbaijan , the cul@@ t to get rid of the nation of the nation , which runs their country like a dictator , he doesn &apos;t know boundaries .
this one kept in power until 2003 , right now in the one who threw the witness to your son 101 .
at least the elderly people don &apos;t know what poverty is .
Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva has 2@@ 30 man@@ at .
and maybe the son of Mir@@ z@@ ay@@ eva is right in our culture .
they live in a great family , they &apos;re loved , and they &apos;re happy .
like this wasn &apos;t right enough to stay alive with a lot of years ...
in the Constitution missing &quot; Human Rights &quot;
the revolution has returned to Cairo .
demonstrations that ri@@ ft in Cairo , manif@@ et the tremendous division in which the country is .
the future constitution , with sh@@ aria as base , turns out very controversial .
the Egyptian president didn &apos;t kick in pathetic .
&quot; we must overcome the transition . &quot;
and that happens to my responsibility , before the town and God , he claimed in public television .
his speech was directed to all the people , especially the Christians of Christians , the Liberals , the Muslims , the Muslims .
all of them , without a remedy until now in a confused opposition , they &apos;re afraid .
fear of a the@@ ocr@@ acy at Ni@@ lo &apos;s Ni@@ lo for the grace of the powerful Muslim community .
and as he explains Moham@@ med Mur@@ si , he almost asked for forgi@@ veness , he has had to over@@ end the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend his &quot; to save the revolution . &quot;
however , neither the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans nor the whole world know very well what this 61 @-@ year @-@ old eng@@ in@@ eer is for the University of the South California .
are you trying to get rid of your power to the judiciary ?
in fact , 2@@ 34 items , whose approval has been forced by a dominant assembly by 100 members of a 15 @-@ hour member of the 15 @-@ hour @-@ old .
as in previous form@@ tions , in the draft , he also says that data is based on the principle of Islamic rights . &quot;
however , what does that mean &quot; principles &quot; ?
this was and still being open to the interpretation and it seems that the Islam@@ ists are gonna take this v@@ agu@@ ing , so as the rule of legal intelligence which takes a more strict interpretation of sh@@ aria .
this is at least what you suggest a new addition , in all the matters to the sh@@ aria is mandatory to consult the University @-@ Ash@@ ar University , the most important Islamic institution in the entire Islam@@ ism .
he doesn &apos;t have to be like that , but this can mean that the cl@@ ero would control the law , something in fact would have as a result of the judiciary .
big part of the constitution is open to interpretation
what happens too trou@@ bles is to keep the military jurisdiction .
during Mu@@ bar@@ ak &apos;s dictatorship these courts served to exercise a hard repression about the opposition .
after the dictator &apos;s .
as you set up the draft , the State has to protect the real essence of the Egyptian family and &quot; promote your mor@@ ality and their values . &quot;
it &apos;s about an im@@ precise design in legal terms that the state of this article could even control the contents of the cinema and liter@@ ature .
speaking of course it isn &apos;t about anything else that of censorship .
by the way , no article states explicit equality between men and women .
instead , someone else for@@ bid or cal@@ med the Pro@@ ph@@ et Moham@@ med and their leg@@ ings .
however , it &apos;s not clear what a offen@@ se is and how to be punished .
as a matter of doubt it &apos;s the design that for@@ bid the &quot; offen@@ se &quot;
is it enough of president or a joke about a le@@ ague ?
as a matter of interpretation , like a lot of other things in the draft he has been introduced to Mur@@ si for his signature and that , your words , &quot; very soon &quot; will be presented to the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans to be discussed .
&quot; revolution has returned &quot;
weeks ago , the opposition is closing in front of the domin@@ or@@ ity of Islam@@ ists .
ten thousand people met in a unusual harmony in the evening of Friday at the C@@ ah@@ ren square and admitted to fail the Minutes before I can get into reality .
&quot; the revolution has returned and end up , &quot; claims Ham@@ din Sab@@ ba@@ hi , who takes the third place at the presidential elections .
the Peace Prize and ex@@ Director of the International Energy Department , Moham@@ ed El @-@ Bar@@ ad@@ ei , declared that the draft of the constitution should be in the history of the history of history . &quot;
through Twi@@ tter accused of Mur@@ si &apos;s follow@@ ers trying to lead a state of state against democracy . &quot;
&quot; when con@@ vo@@ que the referendum will go to his pal@@ ace and defeat it , &quot; claims the oppon@@ ence Jas@@ ser S@@ aid .
&quot; we &apos;re still not tired , the blood of our brothers yet has not been ruled out in the Egyptian media to political opponents .
and several judges announced that you didn &apos;t want to supervise the referendum , so I wouldn &apos;t consider valid .
&quot; the Cor@@ will is our constitution &quot;
by the way , the Muslim community has done an appeal to celebrate a contr@@ anny , by itself , if not in the square T@@ ah@@ ren , but after a pr@@ ayer to the other side of the Ni@@ lo ,
a lot of women cover up with a cand@@ le and support of the ski@@ es taken part in the same to the scre@@ am , &quot; The People requires the application of the div@@ ine Act . &quot;
they demanded Mur@@ si &quot; cleaning the country at the same time as they claimed , &quot; The Cor@@ an is our constitution . &quot;
a fight for the domin@@ ation of symbolic square T@@ ah@@ ren , where he started everything , had caused a similar situation to a civil war .
it &apos;s obvious that Mur@@ si &apos;s supporters didn &apos;t want to risk something like that .
the Muslim brothers signed that the people who are opposed to the project of the constitution would have expressed their high and clear opinions .
now there would be time to let the people decide on the guards what direction should follow the country .
in this sense , the draft of the Islam@@ ists has guaranteed most .

H@@ af@@ ez Abu Sa@@ eda is fur@@ ious with this constitutional process that should actually have lasted for February and included all social forces .
this 48 @-@ year @-@ old lawyer speci@@ alized in human rights and president of Human Rights of Human Rights ... he defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to make a trial during Mu@@ bar@@ ak &apos;s dictatorship .
not because I shared your ideology , but because for him Human Rights is indi@@ visible .
this reason was hit , condemned and prison .
&quot; and now the expression &quot; Human Rights &quot; doesn &apos;t even appear in the new constitution , it regrets in a conversation with the paper &quot; Wel@@ t am Son@@ n@@ t@@ ag . &quot;
the extension of Mur@@ si &apos;s powers to the three powers of the state make this lawyer re@@ plic@@ ated .
the measures adopted are rare .
&quot; instead of strengthening civilian society , which has done the president is abolished it , &quot; it regrets Sa@@ eda .
however , democracy can &apos;t work without civil society organisations .
Sa@@ eda feels abandoned , also by the international community , which observed the ideological struggle that &apos;s having place of the Ni@@ lo with a mix@@ ing of curi@@ osity and tension .
this could be back against her .

the Nor@@ we@@ k Nor@@ we@@ k , the more evil fish in the world ?
the five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the greatest levels of life , not just Europe but the world .
is it possible that the success of a country keep some relationship with their char@@ m for a highly evil fish ?
take a series of super@@ tit@@ les .
get them in the middle of a dirty football clothing and mo@@ da .
leave it there a week .
he &apos;ll be able to smell the ar@@ oma of the Gor@@ g@@ k , one of Norway &apos;s ex@@ quisi@@ tes .
I find myself in the little city in F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes , three hours of Oslo .
the landscape is spectacular and that smell , always present , fleet in the air .
the Gor@@ g@@ k is a st@@ ack in sal@@ ve that leaves in water in water , depending on the evil that you would prefer , until a year .
as a mistake and he &apos;s doing more cold , the Nor@@ we@@ fires come in the tro@@ phy to a festival that are over here , in F@@ ag@@ er@@ nes , devoted to this man@@ e of the most , so to say , cap@@ tivity .
&quot; eat raw and then you drink a glass of a drink , &quot; it says Hav@@ ard Hal@@ var@@ sen , the city of town who is also known as the &quot; General of the R@@ ak@@ ota &quot; which is also known as the &quot; General of the R@@ ak@@ ir@@ k &quot; , which is to organize the festival .
everywhere we see people eating this fish in small milli@@ ons and drinking from a big drink of drink .
&quot; some people like more the aqu@@ av@@ it than the Gor@@ g@@ k &quot; claims Hav@@ ard .
drink can kill the smell .
try some pieces .
if you can help it close to the nose , it &apos;s not bad ; it &apos;s not really different to a su@@ shi por@@ tion that has a few kilome@@ ters .
the Gor@@ g@@ k is a product that comes from a very different time , in which the poverty caused Norway and in which , before the fr@@ idge existed , the fish kept in the under@@ water in water and salt in heavy bar@@ rels .
later , in a winter , when it &apos;s all right , I know , and obviously with the in@@ active ways because of alcohol , he &apos;s eating .
he &apos;s just a generation , thousands of Nor@@ u@@ fires , they were forced to leave their country in search of work , and emigr@@ ated mainly to America .
currently , the population is increasing quickly , more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by the abund@@ ance of jobs , high wages and a complete social services system .
one of Sweden &apos;s people , the old oppon@@ ent and until he does not much more rich than Norway , gets to this country to work .
the Gor@@ g@@ k &apos;s considered something important , one essential part , even though pretty bad , the past of Norway .
you find the most expensive dish@@ es you can buy .
but in fact , it &apos;s all expensive .
Norway doesn &apos;t usually show up in the news of international news and most Nor@@ u@@ fires you like that to be .
here are people still un@@ prepared to say the name of An@@ ders Bre@@ i@@ vi@@ k , the racist of extreme right that blew up and killed 77 people , among whom men , women and children .
in your place , you &apos;re referring to the shooting like &quot; The Po@@ o of July . &quot;
the Nor@@ we@@ fires cost a lot to believe that in their pal@@ ble country one of his own is capable of making such cruel@@ ty and homici@@ de .
after a lot of the current wealth of Norway is the growth , from the beginning of &apos; 70 , of one of the oil and bigger gas industries in the world .
&quot; but oil is not the only reason why we &apos;re doing so well , claims Anna , our wai@@ tress , our wai@@ tress , while you &apos;re going through the nor@@ th@@ k , and that , with your long bl@@ onde eyes ,
&quot; we are , like you say , wise people . &quot;
your English , like most people in this country , is im@@ pec@@ tible .
&quot; we don &apos;t like to show up , we don &apos;t like the war@@ ehouse . &quot;
Norway has managed his oil oil with a lot of caution , except a small percentage of the money from this industry , invested in a special fund in the benefit of future generations .
as long as everyone wasted money that I didn &apos;t have during the years that the financial crisis had been released in the entire world , Norway kept the wallet well closed .
&quot; as long as we can ski@@ p up in winter and do hy@@ pers@@ ism in summer , we &apos;re happy &quot;
&quot; and eat Gor@@ g@@ k &quot; , add up with a car@@ dra@@ de .
I &apos;m in snow doing something to eat something , I &apos;ve had enough Gor@@ g@@ k .
now a bur@@ ger of al@@ ce is no doubt something different and rather dirty than knowing .
but at night , that little fish .
the hotel in which I got a lot of a lot of people in the house who put a rak@@ es@@ k dinner on the one that starts the best fish , or maybe the more you put the most good n@@ as@@ ales .
a TV has connected directly with a present that he &apos;s wearing pa@@ ste and he &apos;s surrounded by rak@@ es@@ k .
looks like the Euro@@ vision contest .
&quot; what are your ti@@ ts for the best fish up there in the mountains , Th@@ or @-@ Ju@@ er@@ gen ? &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s our observation , Hav@@ ard . &quot;
there &apos;s laughter and applause .
a man falls from the chair , maybe I get it .
or maybe it &apos;s the v@@ apor@@ es of all that fish .

Mexico has gone for good economic results during the state of Feli@@ pe Cal@@ der@@ on , but the country is dis@@ charged in a war against the drug .
&quot; my government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence , &quot; explained Mr P@@ pass@@ Ni@@ son to the president of this week to the president of America , Bar@@ ack Obama , at the O@@ val Obama .

before the president of the United States , the prior political experience of Mr P@@ ena was like a govern@@ or of his native state , Mexico .
a very populated state and a fast growth , which surrounded the capital ; the opinions about the new leader are divided in this country in which he used to move .
a honest man
in Val@@ le &apos;s toilet of Val@@ le , for example , he reminds me of honey .
their residents are assigned to the credit of tourism in the place and construction of infrastructure .
to get into town , you can drive by one of Mr. P@@ ena Ni@@ son &apos;s new roads , which is a huge improvement compared to the roads and cri@@ ons that were restored .
you can also see pl@@ ates with your name in the entrance of a modern cop and an impressive muse@@ um on climate change .
&quot; we trust that he gets a real and lasting change , &quot; he says his friend and ally political Gabriel Ol@@ vera Hern@@ an , Chief of Mr. P@@ ena Ni@@ son &apos;s game , Chief .
&quot; particularly , which means security and economy , hopefully the interesting and true change that our country needs . &quot;
after a period of 81 years in the power , the PR@@ I was dis@@ charged by Vic@@ ente Fox in the year 2000 .
Mr. Ol@@ vera admit that after 12 years out of the presidential pal@@ ace , in the game there are many expectations regarding En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ son .
he rejects the discipline that the opposition is missing from the new president .
&quot; it &apos;s a very sincere man , very committed and with an excellent vision of the country . &quot;
it &apos;s a great state of state and , above all , it &apos;s a person who knows to hear . &quot;
however , the other side of the state is not the impression he has a lot of people about his former govern@@ or .
in N@@ ez@@ ahu@@ am@@ y@@ l , known as a N@@ icky City , the contrast with the streets ad@@ essed by Val@@ le &apos;s .
hidden under high @-@ distance high@@ way , in a lot of ways , a sub@@ ur@@ nia from Mexico itself .
and the trou@@ bles are also tough and urban .
by the beginning of this year , the military intervention was called to help you in the fighting of drugs that operate in the bar@@ rels and violence against women is especially serious .
in a par@@ tic de@@ tress , based on a garbage dump , they left abandoned in so the last two years of dozens of women murdered .
more than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr P@@ pass@@ Ni@@ son was the govern@@ or , a lot more tall than the Ju@@ ar@@ z City , unfortunately famous by their violence and a place that is felt like murder of innocent women .
Mr. P@@ ena Ni@@ son &apos;s critics say , in the best of cases , that he didn &apos;t know the problem of fem@@ initiating as he was in charge .
the most critics accused their administration to do their mind .
in a loc@@ king house , typical of the unstable neighborhood , Ir@@ in@@ ea Bu@@ end@@ ea has to make efforts to contain the tears while I show up photo@@ graphs of your abandoned daughter , Mari@@ ana L@@ un .
according to the official version of the facts , Mari@@ ana killed himself in 2010 .
however , his family thinks his partner killed her .
&quot; when I came to your house , you seemed like you had a clean body , remember the Mrs. Bu@@ end@@ y . &quot;
&quot; there were signs that he was beaten up , and the bru@@ ises had already appeared . &quot;
as long as your mother rel@@ ays the story , a photo@@ graph of Mari@@ ana watching from walls , along with a cross which read a single word : justice .
however , that &apos;s exactly what family says he has refused .
&quot; State authorities have treated me as if it was an old spar@@ k , an Al@@ bor@@ ot@@ ator , a disgrace .
what they want is that one simply accept what they say , and that he &apos;s gone . &quot;
&quot; but that can &apos;t be like that when there were so many irregularities and so much negligence , &quot; claims .
the presidential band that President P@@ ena Ni@@ son will receive on Saturday will come with a huge responsibility .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico during the last six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during their term .
&quot; I hope that &apos;s the same type of president who was when I was a govern@@ or , &quot; he says the Chief of the Vir@@ I Ol@@ ge .
however , that &apos;s exactly what families of the N@@ icky victims are afraid of .
Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning didn &apos;t report bad deals , according to the prosecu@@ tors .
the prosecu@@ tors are trying to cope with Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning Man@@ ning Man@@ ning &apos;s .
the trial is focused on Man@@ ning &apos;s military in the military prison in Virginia
the defense wants me to dis@@ miss the case based on Man@@ ning &apos;s imprisonment .
the army is charged with stealing thousands of confidential documents .
the prosecu@@ tors tried to prove Friday Brad@@ ley Man@@ ning Man@@ ning , charged with the greatest le@@ ak of confidential information in the history of the United States , lost multiple opportunities in the United States .
during the interrog@@ ation that the prosecution has reached Man@@ ning in a prior sight in F@@ t &apos;s trial in F@@ t , Mar@@ y@@ land , Mar@@ y@@ land , the Att@@ or@@ land Commander Ash@@ den was reported for nine months of the officers of officers at Qu@@ an@@ tico , Virginia , not a complaint about the treatment that Man@@ ning was going to have .
the interrog@@ ation , which took off during a view of the order of defense that the case of the defense of the defense that the case would have been ruined , has been given a day after Man@@ ning had shown that he had thought to kill himself while he was arrested .
the intelligence analy@@ st , under June 2010 , is charged with stealing thousands of confidential documents while I was in Iraq .
later , Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks published the Internet material .
Wi@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks has never confirmed that Man@@ ning was the source of information .
in the view of Friday , F@@ ein checked up with Man@@ ning the form@@ alities that the officers were after the visit to Man@@ ning during the prison prison during the military prison in Qu@@ an@@ tico &apos;s military prison .
the officers would have asked Man@@ ning and noted their answers .
when Friday F@@ ein was asking about the forms , Man@@ ning recognized that he had qualified the treatment that they gave the cel@@ ers as &quot; excellent &quot; and the treatment received in the premises in general as &quot; very professional . &quot;
the forms don &apos;t show any bad deals , even though the officers ask Man@@ ning directly about the treatment that I was receiving , claimed F@@ ein .
Man@@ ning said that he had expressed his concern about some questions and the officers who were visiting him were talking about those trou@@ bles and told him that they &apos;d be treated , but they didn &apos;t have any evidence in the record .
&quot; I wrote &apos; no harm . &quot;
judge , Colonel L@@ ind .
Man@@ ning said that their intention for that meeting was to get the reduction of the damage system under which he found .
the military said that you were put under that restrictive regime , which is a degree under the surveillance of possible suicide for possible suicide , to guarantee your protection and safety for other people &apos;s safety .
&quot; I wanted the biggest state to know that I was fine and I wanted to stop being under the prevention of injuries ... &quot; to be able to enjoy what , from my point , is a better quality of life &quot;
Man@@ ning testi@@ fied on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Ku@@ wait , where he was taken over for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison site in Qu@@ an@@ tico &apos;s Qu@@ an@@ tics .
he said he had considered suicide in Ku@@ wait and that once lost knowledge due to the heat .
he said that the fact that I wasn &apos;t allowed to know what was going on or what happened in the outside world was very distr@@ aught .
&quot; my world &apos;s down so much to the C@@ enter , that c@@ age , that c@@ age ... &quot;
&quot; thought I &apos;d die in that c@@ age . &quot;
Man@@ ning claimed that once he transferred Qu@@ an@@ tic , most days in a small cell , at least during 21 hours and often during 23 hours , without company .
Man@@ ning said that I just allowed him to have a co@@ aster , a blanket , some of the clothes and their glasses .
he explained that he was trying to move all the time , since he was forbidden or even lying during the day .
Man@@ ning claimed he always had a light from being pointing out to his eyes while I slept .
he said if the cel@@ ers couldn &apos;t see the face when he turned around the night , they woke him up to get back .
Man@@ ning &apos;s lawyer introduced in January 2011 a formal complaint about the treatment that I was receiving Man@@ ning .
Man@@ ning was transferred to the military prison from For@@ t Le@@ aven@@ worth in K@@ ans@@ as in April 2011 .
Friday , the judge asked Man@@ ning about a whist@@ le that he had in the statement of Thursday , according to which , after being forced to get married in his Qu@@ an@@ tics &apos;s cell , he was forced to be held by a le@@ ague in his Qu@@ an@@ tics and other prisoners .
Man@@ ning had testi@@ fied that I &apos;ve never given him a chance to cover up with the blanket .
during the judge &apos;s interrog@@ ation Friday , Man@@ ning said he stopped by the order that he should have left the man@@ ator that he should have dropped off , but he recognized that no one would have asked her to fall down .
Man@@ ning testi@@ fied on Thursday that you were forced to sleep naked night because of an attempt to prove an officer that he wasn &apos;t a danger to himself .
Man@@ ning claimed he told the officer that he could have used the el@@ tic of his under@@ wear or his ch@@ anc@@ ens to self @-@ injuries but he didn &apos;t .
Man@@ ning testi@@ fied that that night they was retired from their cell clothes , their ch@@ anc@@ ens and their glasses .
your lawyers have the hope that the judge has at least taken care of the experiences that happened during their prison in prison and narro@@ de drastically their sentence in case he was sentenced to the council .
the defense claimed he has planned to make Man@@ ning guilty of minor crimes and defending other accusations considered too extreme .
he &apos;s expected that the view of this weekend and wait that the prosecu@@ tions argue that the conditions of detention were justified .
the P@@ ent@@ agon has sustained that Man@@ ning was re@@ qualified to the rules of application to all prisoners who find under custody in Qu@@ an@@ tico .
the charges against Man@@ ning include cooperation with the enemy , causing illegal the publication of information on the Internet , le@@ thal data le@@ thal and public property records .
if he &apos;s declared guilty of all the charges , he could face life .
my American @-@ American identity crisis
he claims that many people were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
the Mex@@ icans tend to critici@@ ze the ones that left the Mex@@ icans of those difficult times .
Nav@@ arr@@ t@@ te makes you think the Mex@@ icans get trapped between two wor@@ lds .
in a recent way to Mexico City , he barely went down by the sheriff and get into the immigration process and he was totally confusing .
a few car@@ tap@@ es was the way to two co@@ aches , a for &quot; Mex@@ icans and another for &quot; Ex@@ tran@@ j@@ ers . &quot;
I stayed there a few seconds without being sure where I should go .
when I &apos;ve grown up in California Central , during my entire life they called me &quot; Mex@@ icans . &quot;
it &apos;s about ethnic car@@ tu@@ graphy , the same way my friends in Boston are talking to themselves as Irish &quot; Irish &quot; or my friends in New York will be qualified .
later I decided for &quot; Mex@@ icans . &quot;
but this was Mexico .
and in my grandfather &apos;s homeland , the car@@ tu@@ graphy or the pa@@ int@@ ings weren &apos;t necessary .
he was just American .
I speak English enough to handle myself for an interview in this tongue .
but I have no voc@@ abul@@ ary level and I can &apos;t get rid of my American acc@@ ent .
so I took my American passport and put me in the foreig@@ ner .
I thought at that moment of this week in which president elected from Mexico , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ son , visited the White House to meet President Obama .
in the day on the day , as the leaders of these two countries , I was stressed , immigration , drugs and commerce .
P@@ ena Ni@@ son was looking forward to the growth of the Mexican economy , one of the reasons that these moments is so likely that a Mexican will remain in Mexico like to move into the States .
he wants to associate with America and Canada and create in Nor@@ te@@ America a trade block in the European Union .
besides , P@@ ena Ni@@ son promised to keep fighting the drugs in Mexico , even though he didn &apos;t mention details .
for Mexico , the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of r@@ ud@@ ge .
probably most Americans never remember that in 18@@ 48 the United States inv@@ aded Mexico and forced into their leaders to give up half their territory to the gun@@ shot .
but for the Mex@@ icans , you think in centuries , not in minutes , the elements you remember are everywhere .
so , at the moment that a United States officer says anything to take the slightest criticism to Mexico , you start to hear complaints , so much in the press and between the Mexican elite , about how Americans are plant@@ ing the sovereignty of their neighb@@ ors .
and M@@ oc@@ te@@ zu@@ ma &apos;s kids are standing in war .
and yet , for Mexico , the relationship that really meant to be a challenge is the one that has the most of 35 @-@ American Mex@@ icans living in the United States .
did we talk about r@@ ud@@ ge ?
there &apos;s a lot .
in Mexico , there are winners and losers , people for which the country provides opportunities and others for that not .
the only reason that there are so many people of Mexican l@@ ency living in towns like Los Angeles , Las Vegas , Pho@@ eni@@ x , Den@@ eni@@ x , Den@@ ver or San Antonio is that in some of our genetic tree , there was a person who could have been the father or the mother .
and most times that person fit in a determined profile , dark skin , a level of study under a poor village , so ...
we &apos;re their descend@@ ants and we &apos;re loyal .
Mexico doesn &apos;t .
and despite the fact that maybe we &apos;re living now the American dream , when I &apos;ve gone to good schools and had good jobs , we can never lose sight that what we &apos;re living is that , the American dream , and not the Mexican .
maybe our identity is not clear , but our loyalty is true .
it &apos;s for the United States .
besides , we &apos;re aware of many of the Mex@@ icans in the class of the leading class .
the feeling is mutual .
you see us like a reminder of humili@@ ating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were from a lower category than it &apos;s not Mexican enough .
our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough .
in your way , our existence is a lie of failure .
if our families hadn &apos;t failed in Mexico , they wouldn &apos;t have gone .
and now we wouldn &apos;t find trapped after this cur@@ tain cur@@ tain , living well in the United States but yet , like lonely souls .
my wife , who was born in Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara , and he was legally into the United States when I was a girl , remember that there is this ro@@ ce between the Mex@@ icans and Mex@@ icans because the first you know about more soli@@ dity who are and in the middle of this mind .
even though it &apos;s a citizen of the United States , she looks part of the two countries .
meanwhile , many Mexican Mex@@ icans I know you &apos;re not part of any of them .
we love to hear the Mexican group the Ti@@ gr@@ es of North , but also Bruce Spr@@ ing@@ st@@ een .
you have the best of every country , but you &apos;re not in any of them .
in Mexico you see us as Americans .
and in the United States we consider you Mexican .
now , to complic@@ ate more things , so I &apos;ve heard for my trip , some Mexican leaders and some intellec@@ ic@@ ans want to go back to connec@@ ting with the dig@@ it .
they want the Americans @-@ Americans to work like &quot; emb@@ ers &quot; in Mexico , representing their interests in America .
we &apos;d say our American partners how fantastic it is to visit that country and pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico .
Yeah , sure ...
that &apos;s not gonna happen .
there &apos;s too much .
and , with the inequality of wages , corruption , gal@@ op@@ ante and violence for drugs , many of us are not so sure that &apos;s a great country .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna stay alone with this idea , friends .
it &apos;s fair .
if some Mex@@ icans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they tried to Mexico a century ago and a half , then they have to accept the fact that some Americans are still being held by how many Americans are in a long time .
H@@ m@@ mm .
maybe we &apos;re more Mexican than I thought .
old batt@@ les , new Middle East
the high fire between Israel and Hamas well could be a unlikely base for peace
will there be a lasting peace between Arab and Jews in the Middle East ?
another blood shed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain .
in the middle of the useless and regular arguments about who started first , lots of buildings have been reduced to s@@ ail , more than 140 Palestinians , most civilians , most civilians , most civilians , most civilians , most civilians , and six Israelis have been killed by the first time .
but even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anch@@ or in their former conflict , as soon as they are in the Middle East .
Arab spring has left everything to pieces like or not , Palestinians and Israelis are trapped in the regional al@@ bor@@ oto .
maybe this would make your struggle even more bloody than before .
however , there are reasons to think that your le@@ thal le@@ thal would be un@@ armed .
a war that doesn &apos;t even lose
first view , optimism seems really hard to justify .
even if he keeps the high @-@ fire fire on November 21 , the fights of this week have reinforced the hal@@ con@@ es of both sides .
Hamas &apos;s leaders , the Islam@@ ist movement he has ruled Gaza since 2007 , will sign the Israelis to withdraw , despite that Gaza has received a good beating .
and even though he killed some of his leaders and put pressure on the 1.@@ 7 million people in one of Gaza in one of the most miserable people in the planet .
in fact , Hamas is winning in the West Bank , the other part of Palestine actually go@@ ber@@ ly for their rel@@ ent@@ ings of Fat@@ ah , the most moderate Palestinian fac@@ tion .
besides , Hamas &apos;s leaders could get to the conclusion that the time is .
since the Islam@@ ists have been winning influence for all the Arab world , Hamas has made rich and powerful friends .
Turkey , a ren@@ aci@@ ent regional power that previously was the most closest ally more closest ally to Israel , has taken the cause of Hamas , has also taken off the world of Hamas .
the soldiers of Hamas are saying that the average moon is surrounded by Israel from Lebanon north , where he domin@@ ates the game @-@ mili@@ tia .
especially in Israel &apos;s southern F@@ lan@@ e , the growth of Muslim Bro@@ ham@@ mad is directed by president Mu@@ ham@@ mad Mor@@ si in Egypt , unlike the most populated and fundamental countries in Arab countries , has changed the balance of the region .
Hos@@ ni Mu@@ bar@@ ak , the st@@ ink that ruled in Egypt for 30 years to their fall in 2011 , had not too much time for Hamas .
in exchange , M@@ usu@@ l@@ man@@ es are soldiers of Hamas and their leaders depends more on the popular opinion .
in future diplomatic actions , it &apos;s possible that Hamas turns out as a lead you can &apos;t exclude , even Israel and the United States .
meanwhile , Israel &apos;s hard wing will get the opposite conclusion .
what the military matter is , they put Hamas in their place .
the anti @-@ missile missile system has shown its effectiveness and many of Hamas &apos;s mis@@ siles have been destroyed .
the Israelis will sleep more quietly for some time .
as for diplomacy , America shows more stronger than ever , many European countries also blame Hamas to have initiated the last wave of violence .
first , Israel has evol@@ ved , especially under the Benjamin of Benjamin Net@@ any@@ ahu , a first minister who ignored the peace process .
even though the co@@ h@@ ets fire from Gaza is over with the life of a 30 Israelis from 2004 , Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists , partly thanks to the barrier to become Palestinian , partly thanks to the barrier to death .
Mr Net@@ any@@ ahu , whose game Li@@ k@@ ud has joined a group of a line even more difficult by A@@ c@@ dor Li@@ e@@ ber@@ man in the prior period to the elections at the final election .
why are you lying to those Palestinian cr@@ ates , give them a state ?
if they really rule in the West , wouldn &apos;t they shoot co@@ h@@ ets as they &apos;ve done their country@@ men in Gaza ?
it &apos;s better to have them after that wall and give them a good shot if they lift their head .
maybe it &apos;s the tough wing , even though the Arab spring could alter their calculations .
even though the Islam@@ ists to take the power in Egypt and other places don &apos;t have much too much appreciation to Israel , their priority will be addressed to the internal difficulties .
Israel &apos;s defence budget is older than their four Arab neighb@@ ors together .
starting a war with the super@@ power of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies .
that the pragmatic Mr Mor@@ si has worked with Bar@@ ack Obama to get the fire is a good fan and I could take the beginning of something .
the Israelis should think long .
with the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic , to convic@@ t the Palestinians in their right to self @-@ determination meant to create a pol@@ v@@ et that a day will explo@@ de in the occupied territories by Israel .
repression is already lying to democracy in the Jewish state and demo@@ graphy is worse the situation as the Arab population increases .
the cross missions against Gaza each or three years to reject Hamas will pay a diplomatic toll every time .
both sides need a pair of people in the conflict .
the solution is still the one that people are looking for sens@@ ational people in both sides , most of the foreign world and this paper : two states and the c@@ ession by Israel for reasons of security .
hope , small @-@ term short @-@ term , that &apos;s the fire to give a little more momentum to people who are fighting for this cause .
Egypt , which must begin to put bra@@ ke down in Gaza , along with Turkey and Q@@ atar , is in a situation without an unprecedented state to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 border .
the Arab@@ s to the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fat@@ ah to join .
that would help the creation of a Palestinian state that the imminent attempt to get a virtual state category in the UN .
Mr. Obama has an important role in what matters to get Israel into the negotiating table .
during your first term left to present your own plan for peace .
again in the White House , it seems to be the same as objection to your attention .
this attitude is a shame of future future .
a stable Middle East is vital for the United States .
this involves a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine .
the micro@@ pack of cigarettes is in effect in Australia .
warnings about smoke risks and parts of the body with diseases looking on dra@@ wer .
the Austr@@ ali@@ ian law is on tobacco and pack gener@@ ic , pion@@ eer in the world , get into reality and replace the gangs and the col@@ ors of children and children and children and children and children and children and children and babies and children and children and babies and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children and children
except for the different images and medical warnings , the only difference between the dra@@ wer , mandatory from Saturday , are the names of the mark@@ ings , all of them in a kind of small source .
this is the most strict regime in the world applied to tobacco .
the federal government in Australia claims that the target is to dis@@ solve the young of smoking by elimination the rules that make this habit have g@@ lam@@ our .
trust studies that prove that if a person didn &apos;t start smoking before 26 years , there &apos;s a 99 % chance of chance that I never do it .
&quot; can you see the children , even since very early , they understand the message that the business company is trying to sell through their mark &quot; , Tan@@ ya P@@ liber@@ se@@ k , by example , how the girls connected to the show of a cro@@ wn with the idea of being a princess . &quot;
despite the fact that Australia counts with one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of the multinationals , others are considering taking similar measures .
the solar industry has served a huge pressure against the law .
red companies said the law would promote the black market in tobacco , in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible .
&quot; the laws will have severe consequences involved , &quot; he said Scott Mc@@ In@@ ty@@ re , in Australia .
it will increase the amount of tobacco that will bring China &apos;s for@@ gers and Indonesia to sell it in the streets of Australia .
other people say their business has benefited after the law approval .
Sand@@ ra has , of Z@@ ico Sing@@ P@@ ty L@@ t@@ d , a small family firm , claimed that the law@@ suit and under@@ cover of si@@ can@@ ies to cover up the un@@ holy @-@ ups of the contain@@ ers had been shot almost from zero , when the British American Tob@@ ac@@ co , Philip Morris and Japan ...
Mrs. Han claimed Z@@ ico had sold up until 6@@ ,000 units to the but@@ ers and that he was waiting more .
&quot; for us it &apos;s a good business . &quot;
according to experts , possible obstacle is the popu@@ lar@@ ity of social networks between the demographic sector which is headed for the plan .
after a series of Austr@@ ali@@ ian laws that pro@@ h@@ seeds the advertising on TV and the bo@@ dy@@ ment of sports and the bo@@ oz@@ e of sports and that they put most of the cigarettes into sight , the marketing of tobacco has passed into line .
Australia has forbidden advertising on the Internet to companies and local website , but he can &apos;t limit it in foreign pages .
&quot; if you trad@@ ed tobacco and so just this little window to promote your products , space in line is the most convincing place in which you say Bec@@ ky Fre@@ eman , &quot; public health investig@@ ator . &quot;
Fre@@ eman watched a raise of res@@ res@@ ts on &quot; citizens &apos; . &quot;
I wonder if it &apos;s just a private citizen who really loves the Mar@@ l@@ bor@@ o and has taken the pain of making a video or if any marketing company is behind all of it .
the British American Tob@@ ac@@ co has shown that the industry is focused more on what involves new regulations in marketing .
the industry has even come to pay for Ukraine to , Honduras and the D@@ omin@@ ican Republic .
it &apos;s probably the WTO dict@@ ates a resolution in mid of 2013 .
P@@ liber@@ se@@ k claimed that the government had kept conversations with other countries that are considering applying similar laws on tobacco supply .
in 2001 Canada turned into the first country that introduced the sever@@ age of including images in the dra@@ wer .
they are currently mandatory in 40 countries , among those who find Brazil , Turkey and Ukraine .
in Britain , New Ze@@ anda , South Africa and India are considering applying tougher laws .
in Australia many smo@@ kers are challenging .
&quot; photo@@ graphs don &apos;t affect me . &quot;
I &apos;m simply not a case . &quot;
&quot; take the ci@@ gar and keep the package , &quot; says Victor The H@@ age H@@ age as he bought a package with the image of a tum@@ or in his mouth .
&quot; honestly , there &apos;s only one reason why I &apos;d stop smoking by my daughter . &quot;
James Y@@ u , manager of the King of the People in the Sy@@ dney , indicates that uni@@ forms uni@@ forms make them more complicated in the shel@@ ves .
&quot; normally I took an hour in ex@@ val@@ ar a delivery ; now I take four , &quot; claims Y@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the government should have totally forbidden tobacco and then , it &apos;s over , okay , it &apos;s over and closed the store &quot;
in a constantly connected world , he &apos;s not so boring .
during the day of Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving to thank you for this year , I had to go through five hours in a airport because the plane we fly in the sky we blew up and had to wait for another plane .
so I had a lot of time to think about boring .
I &apos;m not gonna lie .
you spend a half @-@ day on an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring , even if you have the means to be enter@@ taining , like books , magaz@@ ines , like books .
but every time there are more academic and experts in childhood development that praise the bon@@ th@@ ness of boring .
according to them , it &apos;s okay that we both and our kids are bored , we &apos;re bored when .
boring the brain to get some interesting options and he may encourage creativity .
since , actually , most of us are connected to this or that screen , we didn &apos;t experience the benefits that brings the boring .
so , should we take a good mood for the boring ?
Yeah .
and no .
but we &apos;ll talk about it later .
first of all , like a lot of people , I thought that now that we have more time for the o@@ ath , the bored would be a relatively recent phenomenon .
but , like , and as you claim Peter To@@ o@@ hey , the Greek history of Greek Hist@@ ory and Roman University of C@@ alg@@ ary , in Canada , and author of the &quot; Bor@@ ed@@ om &quot; book , is not so much .
&quot; in fact , the story of boring is very extensive , claims . &quot;
in Pom@@ pe@@ ya &apos;s walls there are photo@@ graph@@ tis in Latin the toilet that they &apos;re coming from the century .
we also need to know how we define the boring .
&quot; the problem is that he has already defined and discussed very several ways , &quot; indicates John D. E@@ ast@@ wood , Professor of the University of City City in On@@ tary , Canada .
after examining the investigations , and then I need the idea of a group of argument .
claims the difference between boring and pa@@ thy is that the person doesn &apos;t do something but he wants to do it .
it says that with the pa@@ thy , there &apos;s no desire to do something .
the main experience in the boring , claims , it &apos;s &quot; the switch of the attention , associated to a low @-@ state mood and a feeling that time is slowly . &quot;
the boring can sound terribly like the de@@ pression .
however , Professor E@@ ast@@ wood says , even though they can be related , people who are bored to see the problem like a matter of the environment or the world , while people who are de@@ pressed that the problem is .
sometimes we think we &apos;re boring , when what happens to us is that we have problems to focus .
in your study &quot; The Un@@ gal M@@ ind , De@@ fin@@ ing Bor@@ ed@@ om in a of war@@ nings , &quot; published in September P@@ sy@@ cho@@ de Sci@@ ence , published in September D@@ sy@@ cho@@ hardt Sci@@ ence , the Professor E@@ ast@@ wood and his colleagues was posted to an earlier experiment in which the participants were listening to a film .
some of the groups heard in the water room a TV show to everything that didn &apos;t keep any relationship , others heard it with the volume , so barely the third group heard the audio at any time .
the group who heard the programme with the volume showed more boring than the other two groups ; it cost to focus , but they were not sure why and you had it at boring .
&quot; when you &apos;re trying to focus on a hard work or an interesting , the acc@@ ess@@ ness of attention can be taken by the boring , &quot; indicated Mark J. F@@ ens@@ ke , &quot; C@@ uel@@ ph University , and one of G@@ uel@@ ph &apos;s studies . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , when you &apos;re doing something boring , like to detect defec@@ tive pieces in a line of manufacture , a music that &apos;s distr@@ acting you . &quot;
&quot; in fact we know that I &apos;m moving or to make it . &quot;
&quot; research shows that those kids who are allowed to move through more and more information than those who are oblig@@ ed to being held to be still , claims Professor F@@ ens@@ ke . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s boring at some point ... the delay of a plane , a mon@@ o@@ tone , a film particularly boring .
but some people have more tendency to boring than others .
to help you medi@@ c , some investig@@ ators developed in the 8@@ 0s .
the scale includes questions like a lot of things that I have to do is rel@@ axed , and &quot; there are so many things that I have to do . &quot;
Stephen V@@ od@@ an@@ ov@@ ich , Professor of the University of the West Florida , claims that , using those cre@@ eps , the investig@@ ators have discovered that the boys have more tendency to get bored more often than girls , and especially most vari@@ ation .
but in general , teen@@ ag@@ ers are a type of group that bored quite easily .
in 1991 , Re@@ ed Lar@@ son , Professor of human Development and the community of the University of I@@ ll@@ ino@@ is , took an experiment in which they put into contact with 400 teen@@ ag@@ ers and their parents between seven and eight times day by day by a search .
discovered that 32 % of the teen@@ ag@@ ers said that bored while I was in school or doing homework , while 23 % said that I was bored when I wasn &apos;t at school .
by the way , 3 % of the parents said they &apos;d bored .
Professor Lar@@ son said that I didn &apos;t know if the current stones of boring , 21 years later , it would be superior or lower .
but he said that what I knew was that &quot; the teen@@ age is a period in which the bor@@ bor@@ ness is a period in which the bor@@ bor@@ ness is in big , mostly because of the children and teen@@ ag@@ ers don &apos;t give a great control over what they want to do . &quot;
so , back to my question : is it good boring ?
sometimes it &apos;s not , since , because of the end , he can get us to get out of crazy physical risks , like making be@@ ts or falling into the consumption of substances like a method to combat it , and as you show the investigations .
on the other hand , many philo@@ sop@@ its and wri@@ ters talk about the connection between the boring and creativity , according to the professor V@@ od@@ an@@ ov@@ ich , which has been studying this thing for more than two decades .
&quot; boring is the way you have the brain to tell you that you should be doing another thing , &quot; it says Gary Marcus , Professor of New York University .
but the brain doesn &apos;t always know what &apos;s more appropriate .
if you &apos;re boring and use that energy to play gu@@ itar or cook , that will satisfy you .
but if you see TV , it &apos;s possible that you meet short @-@ term , but not long @-@ term .
&quot; so , if your son is boring and you give him an i@@ P@@ ad , it &apos;s possible that I don &apos;t get bored , but there will be no way to get out of the way or hurt by himself , &quot; claims Professor F@@ ens@@ ke . &quot;
and &quot; that size of do@@ si@@ si@@ es applies to other situations , &quot; points .
your son didn &apos;t just learn to keep her up alone , but learn to be better in other areas .
I don &apos;t think we really want to praise the boring .
but we shouldn &apos;t be too critical with him .
our target should be , more as well , the one of the constant parts of the constant .
Professor E@@ ast@@ wood agrees .
&quot; our way to see , we need to boring more , but boring is a wish too hard and disturbing like to relate to something that deserves it . &quot;
he says what people really seek is a way to dis@@ connect and enjoy a dead time .
&quot; in a environment we &apos;re constantly over@@ stimul@@ ated , &quot; claims , &quot; it &apos;s hard to find ways of focusing our attention when the noise . &quot;

Anthony O@@ ro@@ I , 19 @-@ year @-@ old student in a community school and the sou@@ de of Col@@ orado , is facing a criminal process for something that will soon be legal in the entire state :
I &apos;m telling you that a day of September , he and some friends drove by Lam@@ ar , in the vic@@ inity to the K@@ ans@@ as border , when he stopped the police .
the police found but@@ hu@@ ana in the car and a time after O@@ ro@@ I received a ci@@ tation for drug possession and items related to drugs .
&quot; treat us like criminals , &quot; says O@@ ro@@ zo .
and are they ?
in the weeks of uncertainty to the vote he had place in Col@@ orado for the leg@@ alization of little mari@@ ju@@ ana , the answer in hundreds of minor causes of drugs .
hundreds of minor crimes by possession of but@@ hu@@ ana are cancel@@ ing so far as in Washington &apos;s state , where a similar measure was passed .
police departments have stopped picking up charges against the biggest 21 @-@ year @-@ old possession , which is legally approved once the law has entered into the next few weeks .
but the most conservative distr@@ actions in Col@@ orado have committed to continue with the open cases by possession of but@@ hu@@ ana and they &apos;re still blind to people .
at the same time , several towns , from Den@@ ver &apos;s sub@@ urb@@ s to the western mountains , they &apos;re voting to prevent themselves from opening mari@@ hu@@ ana , authorized recently , in their communities .
&quot; all this is changing so quickly that I don &apos;t know what it will be next , &quot; he said Daniel J. O@@ ates , Chief of police in A@@ ur@@ ora , right this Den@@ ver .
who take care of the rules in Washington &apos;s state , they &apos;re still turning around the matter .
and they &apos;re still looking for advice to establish a production permit system , manufacture , distribution and sale ; that &apos;s all before the deadline .
they say , for all right or wrong , Col@@ orado goes ahead of the most of the states as far as the use of the but@@ hu@@ ana .
&quot; Col@@ orado has a more regulated market , so it will be a good guide , &quot; claims Brian E. Smith , of the state of the control of the state of Washington .
but Mr. Smith admit any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work .
&quot; doesn &apos;t exist a real precedent to serve us , &quot; claims .
Washington &apos;s law , called I @-@ 50@@ 2 , get into reality at December 6 , which leaves a year in which you will swim between two waters , but the possession will be legal .
besides , there are some delicate mechan@@ ical issues that have to be solved during that period , like the way to keep a balance between the demand for the state of offering a suitable access to the but@@ hu@@ ana and children &apos;s ban .
&quot; anywhere will be harder to loc@@ ker a for@@ nab@@ is . &quot;
November 21 , O@@ ates , the chief of A@@ ur@@ ora &apos;s police sent an electronic mail to their police officers in which they reported that the city of the city would get up for some of those major crimes in the world , and that the police would leave up with some of those crimes in the first place .
the police officer said that they would take care of the city of the city who regul@@ ates the surface of mari@@ ju@@ ana with therapeutic purposes and they will follow after drug dealers .
in W@@ eld &apos;s Coun@@ ty in the north of Col@@ orado , the district prosecutor , Ken B@@ uck , represents a more strict vision .
after the vote , he assured that his office would follow the cases of possession of but@@ ju@@ ana , mainly to press consumers and have them decide to receive treatment .
currently , 1@@ 19 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less mari@@ ju@@ ana , even though many of them have other charges .
&quot; our office has the obligation to inter@@ pose prosecu@@ tes against those missing ones in the moment that you were a crime , &quot; said Mr B@@ uck in a statement . &quot;
the answer has been complicated even in places like the National Security Coun@@ ty , where the voters rejected the initiative on the leg@@ alization of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
Grand Jun@@ sel@@ lary &apos;s police , the greatest city in the coun@@ ty , is not coming to adults for possession of small amounts .
Pete H@@ aut@@ z@@ inger , the Coun@@ ty Coun@@ ty , he was supported this decision , but he also decided not to dis@@ miss any of the pending cases for possession .
&quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s losing time to keep the law until this changes , &quot; claimed .
even though 55 % of the voters supported the measure , he never thought to carry the pot of mari@@ ju@@ ana to the government and the judicial system were easy .
the mystery reactions that come through all the state of manif@@ ge of manif@@ val@@ ence between the officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state .
&quot; this is a cultural barrier with the district , &quot; claims Sean Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , a Den@@ ver lawyer who represents the defend@@ ants for possession of but@@ hu@@ ana and that he &apos;s a local man of the National Law .
&quot; they &apos;ve been so long taking people in front of the courts that , actually , they still can &apos;t accept that it &apos;s legal , claimed . &quot;
to be the first states that you consider the small pe@@ ju@@ ana amounts in the same way as if it were alcohol , Col@@ orado and Washington are preparing to become the cases of national testing as soon as the leg@@ alization of drugs .
while lawyers and officials in the state count with a new legal sales border , they also expect to be anxious to get the federal government , which still fores@@ ees the regard of the sale and the surface of mari@@ ju@@ ana like federal crimes .
the leg@@ er &apos;s lawyers have hope that the C@@ eda Justice Department .
even though you &apos;ve produced some outstanding patients and mari@@ ju@@ ana &apos;s for therapeutic purposes , the federal government has allowed in most of the business companies in Col@@ orado , Washington and 16 states more .
&quot; even though the anti@@ drug agents don &apos;t get doors down to confisc@@ ate a small drug bag , they will probably be re@@ pul@@ tiz@@ ed to allow the functioning of the st@@ air@@ house by the state of mari@@ hu@@ ana , allowed Kevin A. Sab@@ et . &quot;
several towns of Col@@ orado will not wait for the federal authorities .
even before the day of the election , some local governments passed mor@@ ons on any new mari@@ ju@@ ana shop , despite a year before any of them can open .
last week , the Western city of Mon@@ tro@@ se adopted a six @-@ month ban , and he is likely to approve the next week .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to get into a situation in which we grant someone and then have a huge problem at federal level , &quot; explained Bob Nicholson , member of the council . &quot;
&quot; our community voted against this amendment . &quot;
we &apos;re studying for what voted the community in front of voting for what voted the state . &quot;
there are many questions about this .
Pe@@ tr@@ on@@ ella Wy@@ att :
I don &apos;t know the clubs for their views alone now
I don &apos;t remember any moment in my life in which I &apos;m not dreaming about getting a square in Ox@@ ford University .
so my father as my biggest brother had been in the one that I was the best place in the world to learn , a Greek spirit of the contemporary era who promoted the two pillars of civili@@ zation :
however , the two weeks of taking my square in the Wor@@ c@@ ester College at the end of the 8@@ 0s to cure the history of the Hist@@ ory , which triggered the first scandal of my life .
my father broke up and kicked her cry .
my friends were upset .
the newspaper The E@@ ven@@ ing Stand@@ ard said that I was abandoned because I didn &apos;t tolerate some college partners in the next room .
the letter A. N@@ . Wilson announced that I was gone because I had to drink in the cu@@ ff .
the truth was less fun .
I ran out of there .
Yeah , I ran out , because he was under a systematic harassment and intimidation .
not because of my ex@@ trav@@ ag@@ ant name , not the fact that he came from a private school .
I was stal@@ king for a unique reason , which in the b@@ un of the alleged impres@@ sion was something intolerable and barb@@ arians ... my father , the dece@@ ased Wood@@ row Wy@@ att , was an admir@@ er of Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher and I support the conservative game .
maybe you ask what that is now .
well , several reports indicate that a new generation of high school students is suffering a similar pursuit .
hatred institution@@ alized and increasing to the conservative parties is like Ox@@ ford that , last week , a group of them claimed the same level of rights that have homosexuals , the disabled and ethnic minorities .
Per@@ pus &apos;s conservative members , the Cor@@ pus Supreme College they say that they are &quot; often really ... &quot;
they want to create a position in the equality committee in their college school to make sure their opinions are free .
your situation didn &apos;t be promoted by a recent docum@@ entary of the B@@ B@@ C@@ 2 called &quot; W@@ on@@ der@@ land Young , Young , B@@ right and on the meaning &quot;
I showed the hospital @-@ grade student Co@@ oke , express the Party of the Conservative Party of the University of the Ox@@ ford University .
in other colleg@@ es , conservative students say that it is like &quot; Turkish heads for the introduction of higher tu@@ ition rates . &quot;
Luke Black , 20 years and vice president of the Party of the Party of N@@ ot@@ t@@ ingham University , declared in a spiritual paper that &quot; exists in the universities . &quot;
people assume we &apos;re like the Bul@@ ling@@ don Club without even knowing us . &quot;
Sam@@ u@@ el Rober@@ ts , 21 years and history student in Cor@@ pus hall who introduced the motion for a major protection , claims that this atmosphere is &quot; awkward , &quot; as long as Steph@@ anie Cher@@ ill , in 19 years , claims that the attitude of J@@ CR &apos;s members to people who are in the middle of the world are so desperate .
&quot; this is a threat to the economic debate , as for the welfare of members , claims . &quot;
during my first weeks in Ox@@ ford I was more lonely than one .
I came into college in September September , it was a young of 18 years terribly shy .
the hate to the Party Party was at his highest point .
last year , university had voted denied Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher , former student , a title &quot; cause &quot; is cause behind the under@@ cover of school .
the atmosphere would have made sp@@ in@@ ning of sp@@ in@@ ning .
during the first days of welcome to the new university , when the new students know and they know the cat@@ ed@@ acu@@ tics , I got a sample of the bitter that I expected .
I found out that the cat@@ ca@@ kes didn &apos;t just make the fat sight of the mo@@ fa , but they were involved in it in good wins .
the policy of the min@@ ers , the privati@@ zation and the opposition to the sanctions against visas in South Africa arrived until the com@@ rooms in the seminar .
first of all I had to translate English texts in the 19@@ th century and I wasn &apos;t prepared for what came next .
&quot; miss Wy@@ att , &quot; he said the cat@@ ca@@ th@@ tic Harry P@@ it@@ t .
I didn &apos;t say one .
P@@ it@@ t , a guy down with a face that looked like bi@@ z@@ co@@ cho , well knew how to pull bad comfort .
&quot; it &apos;s just that the len@@ cher@@ ers refuse to learn French or it &apos;s just that they &apos;re just dumb ? &quot;
the other university was taken .
they laugh@@ ed the eyes of tears I was trying to contain .
&quot; I suggest you go to French classes in your free time , always and when I &apos;m not too busy knowing people &quot; , sk@@ in@@ ny P@@ it@@ t . &quot;
I came back to my room like a soul .
that night I sat alone at dinner at school , then I felt li@@ ghtly pal@@ e in the back .
it was a second @-@ year @-@ old English student called James as a member of the C@@ A .

&quot; I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s how it goes .
get out with anyone who &apos;s suspicious of being T@@ ory .
for me it &apos;s so complicated , but they know your father is close to Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher , so for you it will still be worse .
a lot of T@@ ories just shows to be ma@@ kin &apos; .
later , in a local pu@@ b , I tried dem@@ epy dem@@ ons .
I insisted that I wasn &apos;t agree with everything that Mrs. Th@@ at@@ cher said .
that trick turned out useless .
a first year from Fi@@ lo@@ sof@@ ia , spiritual and spiritual , that , paradox@@ ically , had studied in E@@ ton , he said :
you &apos;re contaminated . &quot;
other students approved that bas@@ ket .
I became a perver@@ t .
&quot; how do you have sex ? &quot;
&quot; you get an ass on the other , don &apos;t you ? &quot;
I felt like the same way you should have felt the homosexuals before the liberal law .
could you have a normal life in Ox@@ ford ?
would you see me being forced to stay with people who thought I just after the dark ?
would you like me to talk to my natural and natural tendencies ?
the three years they expected me to meet you like a s@@ str@@ aci@@ sm and isolation .
the only honest Catholic T@@ ory was Norman Stone , history of Hist@@ ory Hist@@ ory to my college school .
they hated him for being not just the conservative Party , but he also murderer Th@@ at@@ cher in foreign politics and one of the people who wrote their speeches .
I was barely there .
I hate the place that I thought you &apos;d consider a bad@@ ge and insignificant and insignificant , and for your match to the mar@@ xi@@ ist vision .
in 1997 , he accepted a loc@@ king in Bil@@ k@@ ent University in Ankara , Turkey .
&quot; here you are not gonna be happy , &quot; he told me .
I started to move on the day of Ox@@ ford to my parents in London , finding shelter in my family and friends in the most open minds .
I told my father I hated Ox@@ ford and why .
he didn &apos;t believe me .
when he studied there in the 40 , he was accepted all the political views .
&quot; but if it &apos;s the best place in the world , &quot; he said with sad@@ ness .
&quot; they will never do that , there &apos;s no way between my favorite . &quot;
until my Communist friends always had an im@@ pec@@ tible attitude .
your sk@@ in@@ ny eyes started .
&quot; give him another chance .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve done it alone to joke .
I &apos;d leave my heart if you leave it .
exha@@ ust@@ ed of so many trav@@ els to London , my emotional resistance was deteriorating .
a friend of mine , who also had to support the Conservative Party , had su@@ ed the pressure and had for@@ given his cream .
next week , during a seminar that another Catholic of Hist@@ ory had revealed , speaking totally , I was a &quot; enemy &quot; man , I decided to do the same thing .
a shame of shame on inside , I realized my parents had &quot; wash my brain and I called them &quot; old idi@@ ots . &quot;
the truc@@ e lasted recently .
it was my father who put the last nail in my college career in Ox@@ ford .
then my father wrote two colum@@ ns in the Mur@@ doc@@ h press .
my door was closed .
I was in fear of fear and , like , five minutes , my hun@@ tra@@ it@@ ors .
when they left the suit@@ case and I took the first train to London .
I never returned .
maybe you &apos;ll call me weak .
but no other 18 @-@ year @-@ old should be seen under the level of intimidation and hostile in an educational institution .
which turns out more tragic is that it was Ox@@ ford , that he &apos;s not only the first one of the conservative Party , but that day of today , he hid after a reputation of equality and freedom of thought .

with reason the sample &quot; Valent@@ ino ... &quot;
Som@@ er@@ set House , former Elizabeth &apos;s residence , is the only place in British capital to take an exhibi@@ tion on Valent@@ ino Gar@@ avan@@ i .
the desig@@ ner has recognized him during the opening of &quot; Valent@@ ino , &quot; a gli@@ tch , a retrospec@@ tive car@@ te@@ ic that gathered more than 130 dres@@ ses in the last 50 years .

this sample is a story of a story whose only lead is , &quot; It &apos;s &quot; Po@@ w@@ et@@ y &quot; Gar@@ progress , but that couldn &apos;t have been written without their distinguished cli@@ ff .
Valent@@ ino has always felt fascin@@ ation for the rare and far world in the sky .
in the first room of this exhibi@@ tion , open up to the next 3 of March , they extend private letters and photos with the signature of the most gr@@ en@@ ocr@@ acy , from Princ@@ ess Marie A@@ ga K@@ ant@@ al .
Valent@@ ino te@@ aches those personal memories as a tro@@ phe@@ ts of your social promotion of Vo@@ gh@@ era , in the North of Italy , the north of Italy , in the north of Italy , in the north of Italy .
being in love has nothing wrong .
&quot; at least they don &apos;t go off their pa@@ int@@ ings of their pa@@ int@@ ings on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful night @-@ new cel@@ eb@@ eb@@ ness , &quot; says Baroness Fi@@ ona .
in the 196@@ 0s and 70 , we both lived in the Al@@ ways and we were good friends .
Valent@@ ino &apos;s a spectacular host and enter@@ tainment with generosity and eleg@@ ance .
&quot; we all loved being invited to your bun@@ et in G@@ st@@ a@@ ad , &quot; explain the ex@@ woman of &quot; He@@ ini Island &quot; in@@ tim@@ ate as Mar@@ ella A@@ gn@@ elli or Eu@@ gen@@ ie Ni@@ reg@@ ie .
Valent@@ ino has always preferred the eleg@@ ance to the cre@@ epy .
and yet , it &apos;s a star .
Val@@ za Maz@@ za , look at a Valent@@ ino .
the war@@ ehouse Val@@ za Val@@ za is also forgetting the car@@ t of the mo@@ dis@@ t .
long years ago , after a par@@ ade in Pi@@ az@@ za di S@@ paid , in Rome , we went to dinner to his apartment .
we were 20 people , between whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy J@@ r .
in every detail of the flat , the decor@@ ation , the food , the music , music , and it felt his spirit .
&quot; every one of the guests made us feel important and dear , remember &quot; top @-@ ass , &quot; that started to work with him during the fourth @-@ rate of Paris .
&quot; it never happens because their desig@@ ns are art of art , re@@ kill . &quot;
al@@ par@@ nia par@@ ade
Gar@@ avan@@ i &apos;s life is not a story of ob@@ sessions , but of love well .
he loves people with good education and better tit@@ les , and they love him .
one of the Hon@@ er@@ set House has been transformed into a g@@ lam@@ uro@@ sa .
in the public man@@ ners in names like Si@@ bi@@ lla &apos;s .
N@@ aty A@@ bas@@ al and the mo@@ b , in 2006
many of those cli@@ ffs say that the first Valent@@ ino is like the first love , impossible to forget .
I remember perfectly .
it was a p@@ enci@@ l , a shirt , a v@@ ault , and a ticket from the autumn @-@ winter collection @-@ 197@@ 1 .
&quot; it was a present that he made me &quot; , &quot; says N@@ aty A@@ bas@@ al , one of the thi@@ ghs of the desig@@ ner .
&quot; I prefer him above others for his femin@@ ity , because of his great love to women , because it makes our beauty &quot; , add the ex of Fer@@ ia . &quot;
I like the col@@ ors that uses , they have great light and they &apos;re &quot; donor &quot; to face .
the proportions are perfect .
the princess and the f@@ lame of fashion Patri@@ cia del@@ am@@ pa@@ ola can &apos;t forget the first time he saw a Valent@@ ino .
when I was teen@@ ager and lived in Italy , he was dreaming to have the age and the opportunity to use one of their nights ...
finally the time at the end of the 90 .
I bought my first plastic dress to use in a party in my cousin &apos;s castle , Prince E@@ dou@@ ard de L@@ ig@@ ne .
it was a red suit , sk@@ ir@@ t sk@@ ir@@ ts , &quot; cor@@ s@@ age and a word of honor . &quot;
&quot; it was a dream true , &quot; he says Ro@@ dri@@ go &apos;s wid@@ ow .

Princ@@ ess D &apos;@@ A@@ ren@@ berg keeps their dres@@ ses from the mo@@ b with &quot; the maximum care ... &apos; because a dress is not just a dress , too , it &apos;s also the kind of memories that involves . &quot;
the &quot; king &quot;
the great ending of Som@@ er@@ set House is Marie @-@ Ch@@ ant@@ al &apos;s girlfriend suit in his wedding with Pablo in 1995 .
they needed four months of work and 25 &quot; Hur@@ az@@ ze &quot;
according to the Su@@ zy Men@@ kes report@@ er , maximum authority of the speci@@ alized press , that dress represents a milestone of the high @-@ size the 20th century , &quot; the return of the high society . &quot;
get out for years with the &quot; s@@ avo@@ ir @-@ wo@@ om &quot; elite , now Valent@@ ino &apos;s his best exemplary .
di@@ gging the Big Cro@@ ce .
&quot; he has always called attention to his refin@@ ement , his calm , his mind , and perfect , &quot; recogni@@ zing D &apos;@@ A@@ ren@@ berg . &quot;
the last time I saw it was a month ago in a war@@ ehouse at the Or@@ se@@ o Mu@@ se@@ o .
he was in the Coun@@ t@@ ess of Ri@@ bes , a great friend of mine .
&quot; it was im@@ pec@@ tible , time is not for him . &quot;
if he says a princess ...
the tough@@ est work in the world :
by four euros , the trans@@ mitt@@ ers in the Indonesian vol@@ cano are playing life and car@@ ting 70 pounds of low @-@ stone dust across stone .
there are people for the job that their job is a hell and another that , literally , works in hell .
it &apos;s An@@ to Customs &apos;s case , one of the 400 min@@ ers that make life off the vol@@ cano of the vol@@ cano K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en .
for it , you have to get down every day to the bottom of your sk@@ at@@ ter , where the flu@@ m@@ uro@@ ous gas to get in the Earth &apos;s room .
after throwing big fuel rocks , that in total they come to a hundred pounds , you get them in two bas@@ kets , you get them in two bas@@ kets of stone .
it &apos;s just 250 me@@ ters to the top of the vol@@ cano , which grows up to 2.@@ 3@@ 86 me@@ ters of al@@ titu@@ de , but the ex@@ ap@@ ers take more than 40 minutes in elev@@ ating , keep the balance and spo@@ iling their foot@@ steps to get off the roof .
they know any trans@@ mitt@@ er could get the life , like it happened to a French tur@@ sman who took off years ago for the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en al@@ ts .
K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en &apos;s min@@ ers will earn five euro cents .
once up , I get open between the tourists that photo@@ graph@@ ed them as if they were mon@@ sters of circus and , by shu@@ tting fati@@ eur@@ ly fish , they walk three miles down to the balance that a mining company has entered a bit further , to 1,@@ 8@@ 50 feet .
it &apos;s about 11 Can@@ di N@@ screaming , a company who explo@@ des from 19@@ 60 the vol@@ cano and , never better said , to their workers , which pays 6@@ 62 ru@@ pe@@ es .
then sell it to 10,000 ru@@ pe@@ es .
&quot; as usual is to take 70 pounds , we get $ 4@@ 6@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es . &quot;
it takes three hours in each and he &apos;s moved , but he &apos;s allowed to put 13@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es in the end of the day .
even though it looks like a misery for such a human effort , it &apos;s triple of what would win in the field .
&quot; the ch@@ ick of the min@@ ers is too tall here , where the lesson of coffee is paid for 15@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es . &quot; the day and the average salary is two million ru@@ pe@@ ts .
there , your salary was 7@@ 5,000 ru@@ pe@@ es .
An@@ to has as@@ ma , breathe with difficulty , constantly , and he &apos;s upset the eyes for toxic gases .
your 27 years , An@@ to takes three games in the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en at the K@@ aw@@ ah I@@ j@@ en , whose fuel has already started with a mask with a mask and a special glasses .
he has as@@ ma , breathing with difficulty , constantly , and he &apos;s upset the eyes for toxic gases that dis@@ order the vol@@ cano .
it &apos;s the price you should pay to get your dream .
I &apos;m going to work two more years because I want to open a store or a Spanish or French or French , he promises in a more than acceptable English .
ground@@ ed by life , this young fellow and smart could be a tourist guide , wa@@ iter or recep@@ tion@@ ist of a hotel , but instead of that makes the work of a mu@@ tch .
sharing a woo@@ den of wood with other cover @-@ ups , get up every day to the two of the morning &apos; cause the la@@ und@@ ry will not stop at night , when their yellow bad@@ ge is blue and the middle of the dark .
def@@ ying the shad@@ ows , An@@ to down the sk@@ at@@ ter to the sk@@ ir@@ ter with a little fl@@ ash@@ ness to his hel@@ met , which he has bought himself with his money .
some 400 car@@ ts car@@ ts on their shoulders from the bottom of the cr@@ agon .
despite your p@@ ing@@ es benefits , the mining company has not plant@@ ed the extraction of fuel to save costs and supply any equipment to the brief@@ ers , which work for their own and so the weight .
actually , you &apos;re not even part of the 30@@ ,000 ru@@ pe@@ es .

time is , but misery perpetu@@ ates generation of generation in generation one of the most tough@@ est people in the world :
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy .
the cor@@ ners blame the race , stress and the cost of property and education for not having children .
&quot; Singapore &apos;s population needs to grow up . &quot;
I &apos;m a patri@@ otic husband , you &apos;re my patri@@ otic wife , and we have our civic duty and we believe life !
it may seem to be a hundred @-@ year @-@ old , you know , that &apos;s a bit of a warning of scar@@ ers , but despite that , maybe the video became vir@@ al in Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be in Singapore at the beginning of this year .
the sentences are part of a rap that uses local references as &quot; we &apos;re gonna put a ba@@ it . &quot;
the advertising company who made the video , B@@ B@@ H , is the hope that the announcement will be called the attention of a fun way .
his director creative , Dou@@ g@@ las H@@ ami@@ l@@ ton , says that he wanted to use the power of music so people can handle their national duty . &quot;
this is purely Internet , so we had to make fun and funny .
it &apos;s the biggest problem in this country .
we &apos;re the worst of the world in re@@ produce ourselves , so we feel that this was a subject that we had to deal with .
we knew that the government had tried a lot of things , like throwing up with fer@@ om@@ ons or rus@@ ade fast dating @-@ D@@ uck .
many of those ideas may have been creative , but they didn &apos;t necessarily work .
so we think , why don &apos;t we make it as creative as possible to fix this problem , that it &apos;s a rap ?
six children
the one who doesn &apos;t take it so fast is the Singapore government .
he spend@@ s $ 1,@@ 300 a year in politics to encourage citizens to have more children .
a state of marri@@ ages and parents grant up to 15@@ ,000 dollars by child , extends maternity licences and re@@ part tax benefits .
but all this has had little effect .
Singapore is a rich state and high @-@ tech technology in South Asia , also known by the conserv@@ ative of their leaders and their strict social controls .
Singapore &apos;s birth rate , according to your national population division , it is currently in 1.@@ 2 children .
the last time he was above two - known as a re@@ posi@@ tion rate was in 1976 .
so why are the cor@@ ners not more kids ?
so We@@ i M@@ ing , Director of M@@ atr@@ im@@ nes and Po@@ vision &apos;s National Di@@ vision , says that &apos;s because of a better education and a broader range of career opportunities . &quot;
&quot; that has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities , beyond married and a family , &quot; explains .
these changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the single question , and to dem@@ on@@ ing the marriage and children , which gives a result of the birth rate in Singapore .
meanwhile , a immigration policy to increase drastically immigration to make it deal with the population of the population has created res@@ ent@@ ment between the local population .
in Singapore , there are websites where you open the xenophobia barely dis@@ guise against many new immigrants , particularly the Chinese , which critici@@ zes for keeping the wages and not integrated .
the increase of immigration is also seen like one of the reasons the last year the government of the Singapore has experienced their worst election results from independence .
since the election has had an attempt to correct the problem , with quotas and higher charges for foreign workers .
unexpected consequences
while the fall in the birth rate has known effects in economic growth in a nation , income income , tax costs and immigration policies , the example of Singapore &apos;s also having some unexpected consequences .
the government tries not to build many small houses .
for example , he has started to affect the estate sector .

these apar@@ t@@ ments have 46 square me@@ ters and they &apos;ve had much success of sales .
however , there are concern that they can promote a life @-@ free lifestyle and dis@@ anim@@ ation to the development that they want to build big houses , family .
but L@@ im Ye@@ w So@@ on , Director of the estate company ...
it &apos;s more popular , in the sense that units get off days , even weeks , faster than major units .
this makes it a lot better for our flow of box .
however , admit that the new rules give more clearer guidelines for the development of them , the ones who were before you wanted to offer too many small units in a project .
too stressed .
Singapore is a state .
well , if these new rules can be a step towards the national increase in the national birth rate , talking to the cor@@ ners who work in the financial centre of the center seems to have nothing effect .
&quot; people are very stressed , homes are expensive and it &apos;s also education , so many people are putting it in , &quot; says a young executive .
other people can have kids .
&quot; but for me it &apos;s important to count on my own money and time , &quot; he says another young man .
men and women mention their career , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons they prevent them from having children .
so , for a long way the government tries to push your citizens to have children , when it comes to babies , the sing@@ ers are the ones who have the last word .
private line is private line .
privacy .
according to the Royal Academ@@ y of the Royal Academ@@ y , this is about private or private life that has the right to protect any intru@@ sions . &quot;
what &apos;s private for 16 @-@ year @-@ old ?
how does this definition apply in your daily life and social networks ?
do you understand the dangers that are exposed to the Internet , which would surely not share out of line ?
el@@ derman has inter@@ viewed five boys in between 10 and 15 years of the network .
in four of the cases , they associate the term to &quot; something really mine , &quot; on the personal level , and &quot; on the key and name of the user &quot; when they applied to social networks . &quot;
&quot; my deepest secrets , I wouldn &apos;t go to a post , &quot; says Jor@@ ge , 10 years , when he tries to explain the meaning of private in places like F@@ ace@@ book , Twi@@ tter , Hot@@ tter and Win@@ do@@ ws , where he has the accounts for two years .
&quot; they &apos;re secret secrets , my mom can know them , but not everyone &quot; , claims .
in F@@ B sub@@ way images or games .
I &apos;ve got my acqua@@ int@@ ings too .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t share a picture that &apos;s not mine , or someone who &apos;s making ridiculous , &quot; says .
the kid recogni@@ zes that he &apos;s wrong to publish photo@@ graphs , from naked people , crimes or write humili@@ ating comments or humili@@ ating .
Jor@@ ge guarantees the 35 friends he has in F@@ B and his nine follow@@ ers in Twi@@ tter .
most are relatives .
mother &apos;s up , he &apos;s got the key of one of the accounts .
I opened Twi@@ tter to express me and write tw@@ e@@ ets interesting .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if they tell me , I just sub@@ po@@ o , &quot; add .
&quot; social networks are enter@@ taining , I can talk to a few distant relatives or my friends fast , &quot; indicates .
no doubt I &apos;d never accept a request from a unknown person .
I wouldn &apos;t have anyone to recommend a stranger .
Joseph &apos;s case , 14 years , is different .
the teen@@ ager has open accounts in Hot@@ mail , F@@ ace@@ book , My Inspector and As@@ k , in this last admit not to 20 people in their friends .
&quot; I &apos;m not scared , because we have something in common , music for example , &quot; indicates .
according to the boy , none of you has ever imagined or asked her the address of your house or your phone number .
&quot; if you push me or I demand you just my own , you recognize me . &quot;
Joseph was followed by As@@ k , after reading a recommendation in Twi@@ tter .
the boy isn &apos;t the experience of what he &apos;s like today as a cy@@ ber@@ harassment .
a known friend of my friend was extor@@ ting him in a social network .
they threatened him and demanded money .
&quot; never knew who was , &quot; guarantee .
the victim , according to Joseph , didn &apos;t shut up the account .
&quot; he only put her privacy . &quot;
then explain a series of foot@@ steps to set up a safe account .
unlike Jor@@ ge , this guy would get pictures of known acqua@@ int@@ ings in awkward situations or pregnant .
Yeah , I would , if I get wrong or I get it .
&quot; even though I know that &apos;s cy@@ ber@@ harassment , &quot; claims .
key questions
Mari@@ las Por@@ ras , English and liqu@@ in@@ ed in Education and pr@@ ick , consider that to lead the kids and the teen@@ ag@@ ers must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to report .
&quot; Internet came up like a means to find information , but with the parking lot of these places changed the rules of the game , mentioned . &quot;
por@@ k says that the Christian Mar@@ c P@@ ren@@ sky , kill him in the University of Y@@ ale and author of N@@ ative and Im@@ migration , came through these terms to explain the phenomenon .
the n@@ atives are them , the kids and young who were born with technology .
&quot; we are the medical immigrants we have to teach them , when we &apos;re still learning , &quot; says .
I eat that the subject is complex , &apos; cause we &apos;re asking you to have a defined criteria about what it is or not spread , publish or say an age that the civili@@ zation isn &apos;t for that . &quot;
&quot; also that they are selec@@ tive when what they care about is popular , having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences , add . &quot;
according to the speci@@ alist , the most effective way to teach what is privacy and teen@@ ag@@ ers is through questions that make them reflect .
&quot; tell you not to do it , &quot; add it .
next , Por@@ t@@ era some options : there &apos;s things that you wouldn &apos;t tell a stranger , why do you do it on the Internet ?
or would you like me to publish a photo of you like the one you published from a friend ?
you know what the others publish about you ?
when photos of parties , did you ask permission to the other people to label them ?
and a more , do you all need to know what you &apos;re doing ?
another point is to see that you have to act on line like you do off line .
it &apos;s the same rules .
&quot; one out of the Internet act with respect , mor@@ ality and other principles , also must be in social media , claims . &quot;
surveillance
I was fighting Gu@@ dia , college cat@@ ca@@ th@@ tic , school school , and educational consul@@ tor , you eat it essential that family parents read the social media policies .
to understand each of the inci@@ tes they have solid bases to speak with their kids about opening an Internet account .
&quot; for example , age and what &apos;s allowed to share or publish , &quot; says .
according to Gu@@ dia , it turns out key to remember the sons of &quot; Don &apos;t talk to strang@@ ers . &quot;
fin@@ aliz@@ ing the National Security Summit without public .
the United Union United Union presidential summit ...
Ay@@ E tried to repeatedly access access to the signed @-@ up document in the State Re@@ union and government , but C@@ San@@ ll@@ ery &apos;s sources and of C@@ San@@ ll@@ ery and presidency was going to be published in a first @-@ minute state of the government .
at being consulted by the text , they pointed that the contents had been exposed by the president of Per@@ u , O@@ ll@@ anta Hu@@ bad , during a few brief statements to the press .
the access of the journalists to the information was restricted at all times .
during the day I just passed , in the press room , the video without the presidential council with the message &quot; private session , super@@ restricted audio . &quot;
the little information that moved between the re@@ por@@ ers was delivered by the press brief@@ ers of some of the governments of the Un@@ asu@@ r workers at the date , even though not the per@@ u@@ ano .
the only clear document during the day was the list of assistants , which caused the dis@@ comfort of hundreds of different national media and international media that they asked for major data .
then the Per@@ du Presidency sent an electronic mail to the media with the final statement of the summit , but it &apos;s about Hu@@ bad &apos;s command , and not the official document that closed the summit .
in October last , Per@@ u was the Section of the South America Summit .
in A@@ SP@@ A &apos;s official website , you can confirm that the document was published on Tuesday .
in both international appointments , the Per@@ u@@ sian authorities used to make sure that there were supply systems for all the journalists , but they just kept the brief@@ case of information .
the summit concluded also with Chile &apos;s joint commitment and Per@@ u to accept a failure of the Court of The Hague who was heading for a cross @-@ border .
Per@@ u &apos;s presidents , O@@ ll@@ anta Hu@@ bad , and Chile , Sebastian , they were together during the regional date and confirmed that you will respect the decision of the two parts , which begins Monday at The Hague .
&quot; we will go and execu@@ te the sentence that defines the differences that today we are leading to this international court , &quot; said Hu@@ bad , by its pair .
&quot; Chile has been , and he &apos;s going to be still a mutual country in the international law , the peaceful settlement of the disputes , and the international courts and the international courts , &quot; added Pi@@ ñ@@ era , and say hello to the hands of the two countries . &quot;
confirmation of both presidents that you will be introduced to the CI@@ J occurred after Colombia reported this week the Bo@@ dro@@ will Pact by which he was accepted to the failures of that international tribunal , after a decision on the sea .
the summit was reached with the in@@ audi@@ ences of Brazil , D@@ il@@ ma Rou@@ se@@ ff , Venezuela , Hugo , Hugo .
Par@@ agu@@ ay , suspended of Un@@ asu@@ r since 2011 after the abduc@@ tion of your ex @-@ president Fern@@ ando , he didn &apos;t participate in the date .
the president host , O@@ ll@@ anta Hu@@ bad , was the manager to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit , shortly after midnight .
the le@@ ague read the final document in which he reported 16 agreements and took over the lines of action for 31 projects by a total of 17 billion dollars in investments .
between the agreements adopted mentioned that U@@ NA@@ S@@ ico &apos;s countries will be able to step up to the goal of a dirty citizenship for what we &apos;re expanding into . &quot;
he reported that he &apos;s taking advantage to enhance &quot; cooperation in the fight against citizens insecurity and against organized crime , actions to make more accessible drugs , access to the Internet , access to the Internet . &quot;
with a Europe in crisis , &quot; economic consolidation . &quot;
&quot; we have decided a group of 31 projects that will improve the connection of America in South America , especially rural areas and borders ... &quot; uni@@ forms to our countries and gener@@ ating new economic circu@@ its &quot;
between those projects , mentioned that five to Per@@ u , and they &apos;re located in the trans@@ mitt@@ ers of their territory , from the coast towards Brazil , and two point to a major connection to Ecu@@ ador , even though he didn &apos;t have any major details .
also , the final document mentioned the political situation in Par@@ agu@@ ay .
&quot; we expect the electoral process in that country to serve the United States of the South American Union , which is currently currently excluded . &quot;
the need for America to remain like a region of prosperity and peace , integrated , and good relationships between neighb@@ ors , was another one of the issues highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , the president of Colombia , John Manuel Santos , said before opening his participation in regional date that I expected to meet with his couple of Nicaragua , Daniel La@@ ,
&quot; day tomorrow , it &apos;s possible that I have a meeting with president Daniel La@@ &quot; said Santos .
&quot; we &apos;re going to check all these paths , they &apos;re not exclusive , including the treaty with Nicaragua &apos;s gonna require a conversation with Nicaragua . &quot; underlined .
&quot; with President Mulder I hope to tell you that we will drive this in the most civili@@ zed way and possible , &quot; added Santos . &quot;
Santos and Bro@@ se would find Saturday at Mexico where they are scheduled to attend the new president &apos;s new president , En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena Ni@@ son .
also , as part of the summit , the Ministry of Def@@ ense was gathered previously to approve the Action Plan , which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in the region .
Argentina , Bolivia , Colombia , Ecu@@ ador , Per@@ u , Brazil , Brazil , Delhi , Lou@@ y@@ am , Sur@@ in@@ am , Sur@@ in@@ am , Sur@@ in@@ am ,
Per@@ u has the pro @-@ board presidency .
&quot; South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship &quot;
the president of Ecu@@ ador , Raf@@ ael Cor@@ rea , claimed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which Sur@@ America , in this case , has to learn from Europe . &quot;
and now , that he was involved in the Union at the United Nations Union .
he defended , in that sense , the project to establish American citizens who get the member of Un@@ asu@@ r .
&quot; we have to get free citizens and workers for any sur@@ American country , as it happens with the media in the And@@ ina , but there are still over@@ reacted sectors that want to return the past , &quot; warned .
President equ@@ ator has shown , plus please , please .
the ones who give you to be un@@ committed to anything and , instead , the Americans sign it all .
&quot; it is incomprehensible that the United States Committee on Human Rights is in Washington under the United States funding , declared in reference to political asylum by Ecu@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks , Julian Ass@@ ange . &quot;
he made sure he &apos;s not regret that decision because he has not betrayed his principles , but he has respected his deep democratic values and human rights . &quot;
he added that , at his moment , he had suspici@@ ons that Ass@@ ange was invited to a third country and he didn &apos;t respect his process . &quot;
he critici@@ zed , besides , Swedish justice to demand that he put himself into his territory into questioning for a sexual offence when &quot; the Swedish law permit to take it by the emb@@ assy in London . &quot;
he claimed that there is a risk that the physical and mental health of Ass@@ ange is .
&quot; I haven &apos;t spoken to him since he &apos;s in our emb@@ assy , but the emb@@ assy reported that he had a little pul@@ mon@@ ary problem , nothing serious &quot; said the j@@ ail@@ arian . &quot;
which is the danger of their physical health and mental health in being locked up in a small space without a chance to do the free air .
&quot; that complic@@ ates any person &apos;s health , added . &quot;
he re@@ members that the solution to the asylum granted to Ass@@ ange from June at the emb@@ emb@@ an in London , by the granting of an ex@@ am which will allow you to travel to Ecu@@ ki@@ Le@@ aks .
we didn &apos;t negotiate with human rights , that word we don &apos;t use it in this case , but there &apos;s been permanent conversations .
&quot; the solution of this problem is in the hands of Big Britain , Sweden and the legal authorities , because Ass@@ ange &apos;s lawyer , Bal@@ ta@@ zar Gar@@ e , is making a series of procedures in different European bodies , mentioned . &quot;
and he felt &quot; if Big Britain tomorrow comes out . &quot;
and if Sweden , as well as well allow your laws and as he has done in other cases , inter@@ liter@@ al Mr Ass@@ ange in London or inter@@ liter@@ ate the Sk@@ y@@ pe tomorrow .
he took advantage to re@@ sign himself like a freedom of press and he said that what he &apos;s not touched is &quot; medi@@ oc@@ ity , bad faith and lie , &quot; the bad faith , &quot;
&quot; the greatest enemies of press freedom aren &apos;t the evil politicians and perver@@ ts but bad journalists in the profit , blackmail and extor@@ tion &quot; said . &quot;
that looks like you &apos;re not these journalists , or the ban@@ kers and the h@@ eg@@ em@@ ic countries and bur@@ gl@@ ers and the right way to be re@@ elected in the revolution to continue the path and the right direction . &quot;
he also backed up the decision to keep the ruling to Par@@ agu@@ ay at Un@@ asu@@ r at least until his next elections , to argue that the organis@@ m must be firm and not tolerate the opportun@@ ism , &quot; because &quot; in reality ... &quot;
President equ@@ ator has considered , plus , &quot; perfectly pertinent &quot; the wish of your Colom@@ bi@@ an jur@@ ist , Juan Manuel Santos , from negotiating now with Nicaragua the Criminal Court of Justice .
for the moment I don &apos;t know that failure .
it &apos;s a problem between a dirty country and a cent@@ ro@@ American .
conflicts are inevitable , but they must be over@@ taken by the will of walking together .
we have to process them wide to overcome them and go ahead .
he also trusted in a good conclusion of the sea contain@@ ment that they keep in the same Per@@ u and Chile , and he felt that &quot; it &apos;s right for Latin America to search international failure if the two countries are engaged to accept international failure . &quot;
in reference to the in@@ tim@@ ality as a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecu@@ ador to search for a third @-@ term term , he said that that possibility &quot; with a lot of optimism and joy , though sometimes it &apos;s pretty tough . &quot;
he made sure that if he loses the February of February , he will withdraw from public life .
he &apos;s never interested in the power , but in such un@@ loyal situations like Ecu@@ ador that poverty can only be corrected from political power .
&quot; my tac@@ tical move thought it was me who guaranteed that probable victory , so we have to accept that re@@ pon@@ ility , &quot; said .
of winning it would be my last period in the presidency and there we go out of public life .
if we lose ourselves .
&quot; it &apos;s a choice , &quot; claimed .
he was referred to the new health treatment of the president .
I just talked to the vice vice @-@ president Nic@@ ol@@ van G@@ uro and tells me that he trav@@ eled to a treatment that was already planned , routine , that was expected to go to Cuba .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t mean a report@@ er in the president &apos;s health , &quot; he said .
the chief of State equ@@ ator was involved today in L@@ ima at the State of State Secretary and government government .
deaths by AIDS today is cause of speed .
F@@ abri@@ zio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of evidence : positive .
&quot; it was like I fell a bomb , &quot; mean the re@@ mem@@ ar moment , that the doctor was trying to make it more dirty .
the boy hid his family .
he decided to take charge alone from his illness and he started reporting about it , with such an effort that he &apos;s already lost his birthday birthday .
it is , without doubt , one of the oldest patients in the Hos@@ p@@ ital Hos@@ p@@ ital Hos@@ p@@ ital of Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ aj@@ ara .
F@@ abri@@ zio lives with the human immun@@ o@@ defici@@ ence virus .
so , until the director of a clin@@ ic in the IM@@ SS , he just for@@ ged out of him because he had a cut . &quot;
so , having AIDS .
now it &apos;s possible to survive this syn@@ drome and do it with life .
however , ignor@@ ant of your illness , so many people come when the virus has already caused pressure , &quot; exhausted &quot; your immun@@ e system and are victims of opportun@@ ists .
31 years of the AIDS of AIDS in the world , at least the first cases reported , &quot; The great achievement means this time that the survi@@ ving of a patient who entered treatment in the very timely form and the over@@ life of the general population , is exactly the same as the last @-@ life of the N@@ C@@ G . &quot;
In@@ fec@@ tu@@ log@@ ist and expert are in HIV / AIDS , Vi@@ ll@@ anu@@ eva Vi@@ ll@@ anu@@ eva said that since 2008 , scientists had concluded that the AIDS was not a fatal sentence , but the years of survi@@ vor and life are going to be the most un@@ accounted ation , but the years of survi@@ ving and life depend on the degree of affec@@ tation .
in simple words , the last thing means that who gets the diagnosis of HIV positive to 25 years of age , under these terms &quot; while keeping in control will be able to live without problems until 75 years . &quot; explained the interview .
to rock this advance , remember that the hope of life of the Mex@@ icans is 76 years in average .
well , well , if the death of the N@@ ight is taken off in the last few years , the number of people who died from 6@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 cases in 2011 .
only in J@@ alis@@ co 2@@ 55 passed out in 2011 , and they go 18@@ 7 deaths until May of this year , however they guarantee that there are universal access to the anti@@ vir@@ al ones from 2005 .
- Why are you still having deaths ?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment .
that &apos;s how you &apos;ve seen it , so it has happened to our hospital .
at least in the last 12 years we haven &apos;t had any drug abuse the problem is that patients get very advanced because they know their infection of infection , or be in a late rush of illness .
he gave up a hard @-@ ups , &quot; nine of every ten patients come up when you get an opportun@@ ist infection . &quot;
in your proposal they match the government and government officials in J@@ alis@@ co at J@@ alis@@ co , J@@ alis@@ co &apos;s own patients , too the patients , as F@@ abri@@ zio , who came to have a friend and , like , F@@ abri@@ zio , who came to make the test to a particular lab , just motivated because he had a friend and , uh ...
everything changes when you know you have AIDS .
some people think they &apos;re gonna die and they don &apos;t wanna know anything .
&quot; if I &apos;m going to die , better check me three times a week , &quot; they say not in my case .
the change was to improve , I &apos;m fine , I get the drugs .
the date , your parents only know that he suffered cancer .
I live a normal life like anyone .
&quot; work , I &apos;ve got a lot of activities , my dear , I &apos;ve got an active sexual life , but I &apos;ve got an active life . &quot;
let &apos;s get the test , if you had any risk , then you know if you &apos;re HIV positive , it &apos;s better and if you have the diagnosis , that you learn that they can live like any people , being responsible .
that , your message , sums the battle of battle to AIDS .
con@@ dom@@ s after the counter
big ones are the guests between the health shows and the ordinary citizen , s@@ late Ric@@ ardo Sal@@ azar , who has taken the cause around HIV .
and the greatest is in prevention .
in places dedicated to this task &quot; indeed has increased the con@@ dom@@ s , &quot; before they gave us one or two , now they give us packages to a con@@ dom , and that &apos;s all right , but it turns out that there are people today , and that &apos;s all right .
among the most vulnerable to new infec@@ tions are the teen@@ ag@@ ers .
&quot; what do you want ? &quot;
he proposed to re@@ design this ineffective distribution , that the con@@ dom@@ s are not just after the show and those hundred people find the public @-@ s@@ can in the public .
it &apos;s not motiv@@ ating the deli@@ ghtful .
it &apos;s not about paying them up and the mot@@ el , as he answered the govern@@ or E@@ mili@@ o Gonz@@ , asked if he &apos;d have taken a con@@ dom in his administration .
&quot; that &apos;s not the sexu@@ ality , best it is to get the con@@ dom@@ s to those who already practice a sexual activity , pointed . &quot;
key in J@@ alis@@ co
there &apos;s 13@@ 35 square cases .
the state is 4 @-@ year @-@ old national cases in new cases and AIDS and 13 .
92 % of the infec@@ tions belongs to sex , 6 % to the blood line and 2 % to the per@@ in@@ at@@ al .
it feels like 50 thousand people can be living with HIV as a case of 4 to 5 people who don &apos;t know it .
rati@@ fied by a United States of the United States of the United States is a sentence that dis@@ knows the re@@ structure of the Vi@@ tro Group .
I &apos;d say , well , that the procedures in the survi@@ v@@ ance of the signatures that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars , contrary to international conventions .
in practical practice , the delivery to the sentence issued by 15 last June by Jud@@ ge Har@@ lin H@@ ale H@@ ale H@@ ale H@@ ale H@@ ale H@@ ale is helpl@@ ess in the front of the state of their property in the North of Texas .
however , the resolution opens the door to the main glass of glass in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of America , begging three inconsist@@ encies .
from entry , while the judge of the cause indicates that the credi@@ tors have to rule out of the United States C@@ ir@@ cu@@ ce Law , the cour@@ thou@@ se of the fifth C@@ ir@@ cu@@ ce , which says that the main procedure is in Mexico .
the first point means to dis@@ miss the international cooperation in cases of in@@ solvency companies with a trans@@ national profile .
in fact , towards that end , the Mo@@ de@@ lo United Nations Law was created for Mer@@ can@@ tle Law , setting up as the American Law .
secondly , the sentence states that without the vo@@ wing , recognized in the critical of the mer@@ chan@@ tile competition the debt that they had with their ma@@ tri@@ x , would have not been most re@@ warded to approve the re@@ structure .
however , the possibility recogni@@ zes the Mexican laws .
in fact , Vi@@ tro &apos;s is not the first case you accept the plan .
there they are half a dozen examples , between them , and they get straight @-@ ups and under@@ cover , whose inter@@ companies acc@@ essed the Federal Institute .
the truth is , besides , it &apos;s just that I get the vo@@ ws of the man@@ ners , anyway the Vi@@ tro owners who fought against this in the United States of America , I mean the funds &quot; Re@@ lo@@ tre &quot; like Au@@ re@@ os , Au@@ re@@ os Con@@ rep@@ ence , Elliot International and Li@@ ver@@ pool ,

from another angle , this blame to Vi@@ tro the situation that he faced from the 2008 to so@@ b from the severe economic crisis faced with the United States .

a few people in Pu@@ erto R@@ ico has a mental lesson from the local bas@@ ket@@ ball history as much as it has H@@ ec@@ tor Re@@ yes .
and it is that before a brain crash , I &apos;d get to a whe@@ el@@ chair in the back of 60 , Re@@ yes was just like a small @-@ year @-@ old player , the Bal@@ on@@ c@@ esto Su@@ peri@@ or or president of the Federation .
&quot; I put a lot of bit@@ ches in the bas@@ ket@@ ball through my life , including several to the same time , as when I was president of the National D@@ istr@@ ic@@ ent , &quot; the National Secretary of the National Affairs &quot; and President feder@@ ative .
&quot; bas@@ ket@@ ball has been my life . &quot;
you don &apos;t get up to make that mess .
the walls of their house , almost every decor@@ ated with photo@@ graphs and mem@@ ptions that they give their wide course , so they attack .
Bay@@ am@@ on in heart
anyway , the ones with major exci@@ tement are the one who re@@ members their step by the V@@ aqu@@ ers from the centuries of the 5@@ 0s as a player to 198@@ 2 , when he fulfilled 15 years ago .
&quot; those were my best years , the more I enjoyed myself because I had the chance to be part of eight champion of the V@@ aqu@@ ers since 1967 , it was like taken , co@@ apo@@ shed or leader .
they were many years of satis@@ fying , including five champi@@ on@@ ships running from 197@@ 1 until 1975 .
and then I got rid of one in the 198@@ 1 , the year of Jer@@ ome M@@ inc@@ y in the B@@ S@@ N .
in front of the way he was taken by C@@ uc@@ o , he was a great manager , he said Re@@ yes .
I remember G@@ ene Bar@@ to@@ w , that he had directed here and he was at A@@ lab@@ ama University at A@@ lab@@ ingham &apos;s .
do you want it ? &quot;
and that was the beginning of M@@ inc@@ y , one of the best players he had .
Bar@@ to@@ w then recommended the sni@@ per Raymond G@@ aus@@ se , that was n@@ ati@@ vi@@ zed and was one of our best sho@@ ots .
I remember he said that if M@@ inc@@ y had given him a champi@@ on@@ ship to Bay@@ am@@ on , G@@ aus@@ se will help to bring another more .
the champi@@ on@@ ship &apos;s champi@@ on@@ ship .
for that time I preferred to enjoy your execu@@ tories and M@@ inc@@ y in the National Force .
I remember when we get to the United States for the first time to the United States .
then the World Cup came in , where we arrived room and must &apos;ve been br@@ on@@ 11 of not that little man that made us repeat the final play for the second time , said Re@@ yes .
that group of 1990 is the best National E@@ qui@@ po you saw ?
it &apos;s between the best , same as the one who won Dre@@ am Te@@ am in the 19@@ th of 2004 .
but my favorite was the American Pan@@ in in Cuba in 1991 , when we win gold and we gave him a gun to the United States team , which was pretty similar to us .
that team is not just repeating M@@ inc@@ y , G@@ aus@@ se , Ram@@ on Ri@@ van , F@@ ico Lo@@ van , F@@ ico Lo@@ e , but he also had to say &quot; To@@ o , &quot;
a team that maybe wasn &apos;t the best in terms of staff , but he gave us a gold med@@ al and a great joy was the one of the P@@ .A. in Ne@@ u@@ qu@@ én , Argentina .
with role players like &quot; C@@ ani@@ to Ni@@ eves , Pablo A@@ lic@@ ea , Pablo A@@ lic@@ ea and a youth Rol@@ ando H@@ our@@ ru@@ it@@ in@@ er in substitu@@ tion for the R@@ .@@ C. &quot;
what &apos;s the best G@@ ico R@@ ico player ?
no doubt , that &apos;s P@@ ed@@ z Or@@ ti@@ z .
their number of international tor@@ ne@@ os are impressed .
nobody in Pu@@ erto R@@ ico has domin@@ ated that level like P@@ icul@@ ín did .
and that without counting their path in the different tr@@ aces he played .
who &apos;s the best leader Bor@@ shu@@ a ?
that &apos;s really hard .
we &apos;ve had a very good cam@@ el , which includes Ju@@ lio T@@ oro , F@@ pot Mel@@ anne , Carlos Dal@@ ma@@ u , Ar@@ man@@ u Torres .
young people , I like Leo Ari@@ ll &apos;s job .
what do you think your biggest achievement in the feder@@ ation ?
I &apos;ve been part of the most glori@@ ous era of the National D@@ istr@@ ic@@ um between 1988 and 1995 and that in the end of 90 the B@@ S@@ N had until 17 teams in a season .
what did you get to do ?
there were things that would &apos;ve wanted to help , like the region@@ alization of the minor categories .
for example , that P@@ 11 &apos;s boys just play in their area and just face teams from other re@@ con@@ es in national be@@ off@@ s .
now the kids are trav@@ eling and playing too unnecessary .
at least I see the fruit of certi@@ fied certificates and course for leaders , desk officers and tail@@ s .
that &apos;s good .
what are you doing now ?
the most I do is listen to music , see music vi@@ deos in my time in Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be , enjoy my grand@@ kids and once when I go to bas@@ ket@@ ball .
and of course , enjoy my wife &apos;s company , Isab@@ el , that &apos;s always been with me .
he dies the Larry H@@ ag@@ man
Larry H@@ ag@@ man , the 21 of September 19@@ 31 , in For@@ th Wor@@ th , in For@@ th Wor@@ th , became famous by its central role as John Ross E@@ wing , most known as &quot; J@@ R . &quot;
Larry H@@ ag@@ man , whose role like the oil de@@ pred@@ ator J@@ R. E@@ wing E@@ wing E@@ wing E@@ wing in the tel@@ egr@@ is became a symbol of the av@@ ari@@ cia in the 1980s , has died .
I had 81 years .
H@@ ag@@ man , you came back this year as J@@ R. in a new Dal@@ las .

Larry &apos;s family and your closest friends were with him in Dal@@ las for Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving .
cute Gr@@ ay , he played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequ@@ el , he was with H@@ ag@@ man when he passed off in a Dal@@ las hospital , he said the advertising of her , Chief Lane Lane .
he had a pleasure to all he knew .
it was creative , generous , fun , funny , sweet and tal@@ ented , and I &apos;ll miss it so much .
&quot; was a original person and lived life at maximum , &quot; claimed Gr@@ ay in a statement .
H@@ ag@@ man diagno@@ sed you in the sou@@ th@@ sis in 1992 and recognized that he had a lot of time .
in 1995 , you found a m@@ align@@ n tum@@ our in the liver and put a trans@@ plant .
years before &quot; Dal@@ las &quot; , H@@ ag@@ man became famous on TV like a decent guy at the li@@ ghtly . &quot; Dre@@ am of Je@@ an@@ nie &quot;
in her , I played the captain Tony Nelson , an astron@@ au@@ t whose life looks upset when he finds an attractive genius , interpreted Barbara E@@ den , and he took it to live with him .
it was a two @-@ com@@ edy @-@ and @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ a @-@ one @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ @-@ a @-@
your work in the cinema included well @-@ received papers by criticism in &quot; The Group , &quot; &quot; Harry and T@@ onto Col@@ ors &quot; and &quot; Pri@@ ffy Col@@ ors . &quot;
but it was his oppon@@ ent to the most un@@ stable lover , J@@ R. who took H@@ ag@@ man to his maximum cr@@ ack@@ et .
the dramatic series of C@@ B@@ S chain on C@@ B@@ S &apos;s cl@@ an and other charac@@ ters in their or@@ bit was at April 197@@ 8 to May .
the phrase promoted &quot; Who , &quot; Who ?
he also helped to give the series a record in that time .
when he was revealed the answer in a November of 1980 , a 41 @-@ million tel@@ ler , an average of 41 @-@ million tel@@ lers , and they turned into Dal@@ las in the second enter@@ tainment program in 198@@ 3 , which had 50 million spec@@ ters .
it was J@@ R. &apos;s daughter , Kri@@ sti@@ n .
J@@ R. was pregnant and then he threatened her with a whore of prostitu@@ tes unless he left town , but others also had reason to attack him .
H@@ ag@@ man has interpreted E@@ wing like a dirty stranger with a car@@ is@@ matic smile , a friendly business@@ man and an honest husband who tried that your favorite wife , Sue Ellen ...
&quot; I know what I want in J@@ R &apos;s las@@ er , &quot; he said H@@ ag@@ man in 1988 .
I should say , &quot; Here lies the honest citizen J@@ R. E@@ wing E@@ wing E@@ wing E@@ wing E@@ wing E@@ wing . &quot;
this is the only negoti@@ ate you lost .
major victory , the original series of the original , remembered Friday to H@@ ag@@ man as someone &quot; huge , inside and out of the screen . &quot;
it &apos;s un@@ forgi@@ vable , and ir@@ re@@ plac@@ eable , for millions of admir@@ ers in the world , and in hearts of each of us , that we had the lucky to know him and love it .
ten episo@@ des of the new &quot; Dal@@ las &quot; was transferred a few months ago with great success for the T@@ N@@ T channel .
it was over the five @-@ season tape .
at once there wasn &apos;t a War@@ ner ruling or T@@ N@@ T about how to handle H@@ ag@@ man &apos;s loss .
For@@ t Wor@@ th Wor@@ th , Texas , it was son of the ac@@ tress and singer Mary Martin Martin , who was the kind of like &quot; South Pacific &quot; and &quot; Peter P@@ an . &quot;
Martin was still a teen@@ ager when he was in 19@@ 31 during his marriage with the lawyer H@@ ag@@ man .
he tried lucky in New York &apos;s New York scenes at first , and then he served in the Air Force 19@@ 52 to 1956 .
as long as he was there met the young woman , I &apos;ve been able to get married .
the couple had two kids , P@@ rest@@ on and Hei@@ di , and they lived for long time in M@@ ali@@ bu &apos;s hot city , where they belong many cel@@ eb@@ ons .
in 2001 , he gave their memories &quot; hello Dar@@ lin &apos; &quot; T@@ all &apos;s , T@@ all &apos;s , T@@ ales , T@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t put anything in there that I believe it was to hurt someone or some way , &quot; he said to P@@ ren@@ sa A@@ soci@@ ada in that time .
after the liver trans@@ plant turned into the donation of organ donation and trained as volunte@@ er in a hospital to attend the frightened patients .
&quot; I advise you , I give you courage , I meet them when they come for their sur@@ geon , and then &quot; he said in 1996 . &quot;
I &apos;m trying to offer some comfort , like &quot; fear , it &apos;ll be a little awkward for a short time , but they &apos;re gonna be fine . &quot;
he was also against the habit of smoking and involved in several campaigns .
start running the F@@ in the world .
every week , the students expl@@ oring issues like the nuclear war , the zom@@ bies , the zom@@ bies and vir@@ als , and global warming .
this sem@@ ester , when Professor Stuart Ch@@ arm@@ é decided to im@@ provi@@ se a course about the end of the world , I knew the end of the world is coming back to the end of the world .
but Ch@@ arm@@ é had no idea what I was hoping for in the next couple of months , the cat@@ ch@@ liquid Sandy , a beautiful prosecutor who has called &quot; de@@ ud@@ de &quot; and a major conflict involving Israel , the place where the Christians in the end of times think that in the end of the end of times they think that the most of the Christians in the last time believe that in the end of times they think that the most of the Christians in the last time believe that in the end of
&quot; I didn &apos;t realize that this was gonna be the most apo@@ cal@@ li@@ tic sem@@ ester that has had , Ch@@ arm@@ é this week ... &quot;
if one analy@@ zed what has been happening in the world today as if we were going to 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
and remember that bad is good for those gu@@ ts .
and he &apos;s not the only teacher he offered to school .
in T@@ emp@@ le , Professor Barry V@@ ack@@ er is im@@ pending the course &quot; Media , culture and the end of the world . &quot;
every week , the students expl@@ oring issues like the nuclear war , the zom@@ bies , the zom@@ bies and vir@@ als , and global warming .
&quot; we analy@@ zed why these ideas spread with time , &quot; he said , and the way that they offer hypo@@ the@@ tic scenes that they were certain human behavior .
if the nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists , for example , it could blow a war .
this month students analy@@ zed movies with apo@@ cal@@ ic issues and expl@@ ored how they compare with examples of real life .
&quot; I tried to inform the students about what is possible , likely , credible and impossible &quot; , said V@@ ack@@ er .
at the main campus at Pen@@ n@@ sy@@ lv@@ ania University , the American Hist@@ ino@@ ania Hist@@ ory professor Matthew R@@ est@@ all and his colleague A@@ restaurant Sol@@ ari , an ad@@ visor teacher in the Ar@@ t world .
&quot; we didn &apos;t add &apos; 2012 &apos; to always tell the choice of im@@ course , in case the world isn &apos;t over , &quot; he said R@@ est@@ all . &quot;
despite the &quot; imminent routine &quot; , students must study , create projects and take final tests .
in Pen@@ n State , the final test will be taken on the eve of Apo@@ cal@@ p@@ sis , which doesn &apos;t leave the students another choice more than working at the same night as the world is supposed to end , R@@ est@@ all .
school was pretty popular .
&quot; he took up in two hours , &quot; he said R@@ est@@ all about their course to high school , which filled with 35 students .
we got messages for mail for weeks and weeks before the sem@@ ester of the sem@@ ester , people who ask whether there was still room .
students , by their way , make sure the course is one of the most interesting .
&quot; find me fascinating to see what people do to hold themselves to themselves , &quot; he said Brid@@ gi@@ d Rob@@ inson , a student of the race in Re@@ li@@ gi@@ field , New Jersey . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the gu@@ m mentality , secular religious , it &apos;s just a matter of comfort or the absence of the same .
will We@@ k@@ esa , a student of P@@ si@@ co@@ logy and En@@ fer@@ deserve , 25 years said to have seen all the film films .
&quot; never heard about a class that could teach that , &quot; he said .
enjoy it .
but no student inter@@ viewed - and a lot less than a teacher said to believe in the tu@@ be of December 21 .
&quot; our first project tried about the ma@@ ster@@ ec@@ y and some way we dis@@ appoint it , Julie Z@@ eg@@ len , the last year in T@@ emp@@ le , from 21 years and West Ch@@ ester . &quot;
the may@@ es never said the end of the world , it &apos;s just a key point on the calendar , said R@@ est@@ all .
but he had an anxiety in Western culture , which goes back to several centuries , that people react to the changes around their pre@@ aching around the world .
Internet has caused a boom of these specul@@ ations .
&quot; in other parts , people don &apos;t think about this , &quot; he said .
mostly in the English talks .
Joseph D@@ ough@@ er@@ ty , a religion of the University of the University that im@@ part at the Philipp@@ ines this year , responded quickly to the question of if I knew about some course of the world .

we got the Pope &apos;s pardon .
R@@ est@@ all has noticed that along the years he has spoken of a lot of days in the final trial , and he said that if it &apos;s not in December on December , &quot; people will begin to think immediately in the next date &quot; or a paradox that December December 21 is the beginning of a seven @-@ year @-@ old period . &quot;
students and teachers are taking the date .
several said that they think to go to parties &quot; the world . &quot;
&quot; maybe call some friends to tell us together , &quot; he said Sam@@ ira Ford , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old communications student .
